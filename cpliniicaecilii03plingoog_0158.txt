‘Rusticus ille tuus sumit trechedipna,

madore animo, with somewhat too
great eagerness.

quod possit illis sufficere: with
reference to Pliny's statement that they
were constructing one ‘longe numerosius
laxiusque’ The Aldine edition reads
‘illi,' which can hardly be right. ‘Illis'
is the conjecture oi Catanaeus‚ while
Mommsen suggests tibi, which, however,
would seem to require not ‘possit suffic·
ere,’ but ‘videtur sufficere.’

§ 3. suadendum sit ; a milder word
than ‘tu constitues quid oporteat fieri,’
and ‘oportet eos contentos esse' above,
because there seems to have been no
jobbery or structural lault about the bath,
though the site was ill-chosen.

architecti tibi deesse non possunt:
nulle provincie est, etc. cf. Ep. 18,
‘in omni provincia inveniuntur quis
credi possit, et ideo non deerunt tibi,'
etc.

ex Graecia The various branches of

science and scientific workmanship were
nearly all in the hands of Greeks. Not
only musicians, teachers oi grammar and
rhetoric, but physicians, sculptors, and
to a large extent painters, belonged to
this nationality. With regard to archi·
tects, Friedlander, vol. iii. p. 265, points
out that Roman architects were com·
paratively numerous. In particular under
Nero, Severus and Celer enjoyed agreat
reputation, while Domitians palace was
built hy Rabirius, Mart. vii 56. Pliny
too entrusted the building os a temple of
Ceres near one of his estates to an archi-
tect named Mustius, Ep. ix 39. Trajan’s
great architect, Apollodorus oi Damascus,
isa striking exception. No doubt, how-
ever, the subordinate architects con·
cemed with the details oi the works
were to a very large extent Greeks, in so
sar as they were not attached to the
army, as no doubt many oi these ‘periti
et ingeniosi homines' were. We have
mentioned, C. I. L. vi, 1886, a ‘prae-
lectus architectus cui maxima erat cura
publicarumiabricarum.' Outofsorty-two
architects mentioned in inscrr. thirteen
are military officials, and of the rest thir-
teen are Roman citizens, thirteen freed-
men, an} three slaves. See Friedlander,
iii p. 16.
