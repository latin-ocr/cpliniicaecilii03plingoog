INTRODUCTION 21

. having in conjunction with Herennius Senecio undertaken the
cause of the province of Baetica against its proconsul Baebius
Massa The accusation was successful, but Herennius was
accused of ‘impietas' for his conduct of the case,1 and his
subsequent execution, together with the death or banishment
of several more of his friends, were, as Pliny says‚² like so
many· thunderbolts falling round him, which left him singed, if
not injured; while in another letter³ he speaks of his oratorical
studies as having been a cause of danger as well as of promotion.
It must not, however, be· forgotten, that in these and similar

passages4 written under Trajan, Pliny would have every motive -

to forget the favours shown him by Domitian; and when he
says in the Panegyric,⁵ ‘cursu quodam provectus ab illo insidio-
sissimo principe, antequam profiteretur odium bonorum, post-
quam professus est, substiti,' we must remember that at least as
late as 94 or 95 Α.Ι)., zie. in the middle of the reign of terror,
he was appointed by Domitian ‘praefectus aerarii militaris.'⁶
Some of his apprehensions, therefore, we may not unfairly
suppose, were put on, that his position might not seem different
from that of the other senators. However that may be, with
the death of Domitian an obstacle to the progress of Pliny’s
career was removed. But he had several losses to deplore ¹1
among his own circle. His wife, probably his second wife, the
daughter of Pompeia Celerina, died about this timel His
friend and adviser, Corellius Rufus, having lived to see the
dawn of brighter times, put an end to his own life ;8 while,
greatest loss of all, the venerable Verginius Rufus died in the
beginning of 97 Α.]).9 With the accession of Nerva liberty, or
at any rate as much of it as the high-sounding ‘libertas'
implied‚ was restoredfl⁰ and a reaction set in against the crea-
tures of the re'gr'me that had passed away. In this reaction
Pliny played his part. Publicius Certus had had some share
in the death of Helvidius and Pliny, ‘in the first days of
, recovered liberty,' took the opportunity of attacking him in the
senate.11 That body, however, was timorous and uncertain of
