INTRODUCTION 53

their peculiar observances were freely ridiculed, while their
occasional outbreaks of fanatical intolerance were now and
again punished by expulsion from the city, which, however,
was, and was probably intended to be, only temporary. But
the close connection of the client-kings of Judaea with the im·
perial family ensured the Jews against any more real or
systematic persecution than the occasional Jew-baitings which
we hear of from time to time in the great cities. Even con·
versions toJudaism,especially among the lower orders and women, ἲ
were by no means unheard of (cf. especially Hor. Sat. i 4, l
143 ; and Juv. xiv 97), and there is nothing to show that up ³
to the time of Domitian these conversions were in any way ἰ
interfered with. <Christianity, therefore, we may fairly say, was
not only assisted 1n its extension by the widespread dispersion
of the Jews throughout the Roman empire, but it also profited,
and at a‘ very important time, by the toleration which Judaism
received from the government. To persecution it was no doubt
subject, but it was Jewish persecution and not Roman (cf.

1 Thessal. ii 15). Indeed, on more than one occasion the
Christians were saved from the violence of the Jews by Roman
protection. Itis possible that a disputed passage in Suetonius
(Claud 25), may be explained in this way, ‘Iudaeos impulsore
Chresto assidue tumultuantes Roma expulit! The Jews
raising constant tumults against the Christians were expelled
from Rome by Claudius. It seems quite possible that the
words ‘impulsore Chresto' are merely an inaccuracy of Sue-
tonius, who knew that the tumult was concerned with Christus
and inferred that he was its promoter That there were ·

Christians rn Rome at the date of Paul's Effffe, 5-8· ··..·,An is
ὢ· that they‘b‘elonged almost exclusively to the class of
'libertini and were of Jewish or Greek origin, is equally clear
from the salutations' rn the last chapter They could not,
however, have been very numerous, for they were allowed
without interference to meet Paul on his arrival at Appii
Forum, while the practice of their religion was clearly subject
to no restriction, since for two whole years Paul‘ received all
that went in unto him, preachingt the kingdom of God‚ and
teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all
boldness, none forbidding him’
Up to this date, 62 and ,63 A.D., all seems clear and con·
