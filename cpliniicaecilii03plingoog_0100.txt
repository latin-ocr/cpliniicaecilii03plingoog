viii 1203 Pliny, ii 11, iii 4, iii 9, vi
29. According to Mommsen’s Index
Marius Priscus was a native of Baetica,
iii 9 3, consul probably in 87, sep·
temvir epulonum, ii 11, 12, and pro·
consul of Africa. On being accused
Marius ‘omissa defensione iudices petiit,'
ii 11, 2 ; ιζι. he pleaded guilty of minor
malpractices such as might be tried by
the recuperatores or iudices recuperatorii,
a board of three or five members who
had only to decide upon the money to be
. reimbursed. The merciam, however,
of going before the iudices seems to have
involved infamia (see iv 9), ‘negant enim
congruens esse retinere in senatu cui ψ
iudices dederis) Pliny and Tacitus, who
had been assigned as advocates to the
provincials by the senate, objected that
the accusations were too heavy to go
before the iudices. After some dispute

, it was agreed that Marius Priscus should

be tried before the iudices on the charge
of repetundae, but the parties to whom
Marius was said to have sold the deaths
of innocent persons should be summoned
before the senate. Vitellius Honoratus,
accused of having bought the exile of a
Roman eques, and the death of seven of
his friends for 3oo‚000 sesterces, Flavius
Marcianus,ofhavingcausedanothereques
to be scourged‚ condemned to the mines,
and strangled bya payment of 700‚ooo
sesterces, were accordingly. summoned.
Honoratus was dead, but Marcianus

complice, and the case was put off till
the nextmeeting of the senate in January
100, when the emperor himself presided.
Meanwhile Marius had been condemned
by the iudices on the charge of repe·
tundae (ii 11, 13), ‘erat ergo perquam
, onerosum accusare damnatum' After a
three days' trial, it was decreed, on the
proposal of Cornutus Tertullus, one oi the
consules designati (the trial therefore was
later than the 9th of January), ‘septin-
genta milliaquae acceperatMarius aerario

inferenda: Mario urbe Italiaque inter·
dicendum: Martiano hoc amplius Africa.’
It was carried as a rider, ‘quod ego et
Tacitus iniuncta advocatione diligenter et
fortiter functi essemus, arbitrari senatum
ita nos fecisse ut dignum mandatis parti-
bus fuerit.’ Whether the case of Classi-
cus was begun in September 99 or Sep-
tember 101 is disputed between Momm·
sen, who takes the latter view‚andMasson,
Stobbe, and Peter, who take the former.
A comparison of iii 4, 2, and ad Trai.
8, 3, prove September to have been the
date at which the case was given to Pliny.
In September 100 Pliny was consul, and

therefore 99 and 101 aloneremain. The .

chief argument for 99 seems to be the
order in which Pliny mentions the cases
in vi 29. But stronger arguments on
the other side are (Ι) iii 4, 8, ‘Compu-
tabam si munere hoc iam tertio sungerer,'
and (a) as both cases were during the
praefecture of th'e aerarium, the hesitation
as to whether his duties would allow him
to undertake the case would naturally be
expressed with regard to the former of
the two cases. Mommsen’s view, how·
ever, supposes that Pliny was praefectus
aerarii-Saturni for four years instead of
three, 98-101 an. See also p. 23, note8.

consules ordinarii were designated at the
end of the year3 the consules suffecti not
till the following January; see above.
The consul designatus, therefore, must be
Seru Iulius Frontinus. If it had been
Trajan, as the reading ‘censuisses' would
imply, the words at the end of the letter,
‘opto ut existimes constare rationem'
would be needless.

nomina nostra in urnam conici.
The procedure seems to have been this:
when a governor was accused of repetun-
dae, if the provincials did not ask for any
particular advocate, the senate named
several,who were then selected bysortitio.
The provincials, however, often did ask
for some particular patronus; cf. iii 4,
2, ‘Legati provinciae Baeticae advocatum
