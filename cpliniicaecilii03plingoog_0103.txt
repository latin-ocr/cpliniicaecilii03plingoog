On the relation os Budaeus to the Codex
parisiensis, see introduction, p. 67. It
is not necessary to suppose that the money
was given to make up the senatorial cen·
susos 1‚200,000 HS. A provincial with
only the minimum census, unless his other
claims had been overpowering, would
probably have had little chance of re-
ceiving the honour. Voconius had already
received the inheritanceol his father, and
Pliny specially recommends him on the
ground oi the ‘paternarum facultatum
splendor’ ; and the bounty oi his mother
was not so much a sine qua non as a
splendid endowment ior the promised
dignity. After all the property was not
extraordinarily large. The fortune oi
Cu. Lentulus, the augur, and Nero’s
⁴ freedman Narcissus, was ten times as
large. As Mommsen says, Rom. Gesclr.
v 68, no places enjoyed greater iacilities
ior trade than the towns on the east coast
oi Spain3 and Saguntum, apparently
the native town of Voconius (C. Ι. L. ii
3866 and 3865a), not sar from the mouth
of the navigable river Pallantias, had long
been rich and prosperous.

codicillis. Here in its ordinary sense
of a letter or petiti0n; ci. Tac. Ann.
iv 39, ‘componit ad Caesarem codi-
cillos'; Suet. Tib. 51 ; Claud. 5, etc.
Sometimes it means a diploma, or cabinet
order ol the emperor, Suet. Tib. 22,
‘hunc tribunus militum custos appositus
occidit, lectis codicillis, quibus ut id
faceret, jubebatur’3 also id. Calz'g. 18,
‘sed et senatori ob eandem causam codi-
cillos, quibus praetorem eum extra ordi·
nem designabat’ As a legal term it was
a short addition to a will already made3

cipatio’ was the old ceremonial sale
‘per aes et libram.’ In it, owing to the
non-existence ol documentary forrns, a
number of symbolical acts had to be per·
formed, the most important being the
traditio or actual delivery of the thing
sold or its symbol. Mancipatio could

only take place between citizens, and in
regard to ‘res mancipi,' ol which land
and slaves were the most important.
Besides the vendor i‘qui mancipio dat ’)
and the purchaser (‘qui mancipio ac·
cipit’), five witnesses were required and
a libripens with ⁴the scales ; see Gaius,
i 119, and Maine, Amient Lam p. 278.
In later times the formos mancipatio
was observed as a ‘venditio imaginaria’
in the cases (1) of makinga ‘testamentum
per aes et libram,' see Maine, p. 2173
(2) ol emancipating a son from the
patria potestas; and (3) of making a·
donatio or liberalitas to any one con·
sisting of things, included under ‘res
mancipi! So in the present instance the
fundi were made over to Voconius by his
mother by means ol a fictitious sale with ,
all its formalities, ‘quae in emancipatione
inplenda solent exigi’ He would have
to place a sesterce in the scales held by
the libripens, and say ‘hanc ego rem

ex iure Quiritium meam esse ai0, eaque ·

mihi empta est hoc aere aeneaque libra’
in this sense the phrase ‘nummo uno
addicere* is used, because the buyer put
down a sesterce, ‘dicis causa,' ae. ior
iorm's sake; cf. Hor. Sat. ii 5, roo-8,
‘si quis Forte coheredum senior male
tussiet, huic tu Dic, exparte tua seu fundi
sive domus sit Emptor, gaudentem nummo
te addicere! Cic Rab. Post. 17, 45,
‘ecquis est ex tanto populo qui bona C.
Rabirii Postumi nummo sestertio sibi ad-
dici velit i’ Suet. Caes. 5ο, ‘cui bello civili
super alias donationes amplissima praedia
ex auctionibus hastae nummo addixit! -
