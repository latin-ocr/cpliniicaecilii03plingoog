seems to im ly that a daily allowanoe
and not a tired sum was the reward
established by the emperor.

ego contrascribo ‘iselastiei no-
mine) I am in the habit of countir·
signing the draits for payment with the
words ‘under the head of iselastic money.’
This is Orelli's reading and explanation
of the passage in Aventius, ‘ego contra
scribo iselastici nomine,’ and it seems to
me entirely satisfactory. Catanaeus alters
it to ‘iselasticorum nomine,’ and Keil,
on Mommsen’s suggestion, emends to
‘ego contra servo iselastici nomine data’
The drafts for payment of these pensions
would be brought by the procurators to
be countersigned by the governor of the
province in the form ‘tot denarii solvun-
tor huic vel iiii athletae iselastici nomine!
The term ‘contrascriba’ is found in an
inscrip, Orell. 3208, and is equivalent to
ἀντιγραφεύς.
ita ut vehementer addubitem
Aventius has ‘itaque eorum vehementer
addu.,’ which Beroaldus alters to ‘ita
¹ ut veh. addu’ Cf. Ep. ii 19, 1, ‘quam-

used here in its Greek sense of wages,
pay, or salary, cf. Polyb. iii 25, 43
st. Luke iii 14, ‘apreute τοῖς ὀψωνίοις
ὑμῶν ;’ though it is quite possible that
the rewards may have consisted partly in
corn, wine, or oil. Cf. the use of spor·
tula both for iood and money.

sieut non dentur, etc, that is to say,
the pension ceased as soon as the privi-
lege of being ‘iselastici' was taken away
from these agones. The most reasonable
(congruens) thing, according to medem
ideas, would be that the victors in ‘ise-
lastici ludi¹ should retain their vested
interests; while victors in ludi afterwards
made iselastici would be unaffected by
the change. ,

‘ne' in the sense of whether, cf. Cic.
