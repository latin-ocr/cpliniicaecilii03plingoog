eiusdem responsis’ These iorty·six letters are those numbered
in the present edition 41-121. The number forty-six is made
up by including Trajan’s answers under Pliny’s letters, and by

. counting (in Ep. 58) the letters of Domitian and the edict of

, Nerva The first os these letters (41-3) is numbered xxvii,
and the last (120-1) lxxiii. In his dedicatory letter to Cardinal
Bembo, Avantius says, ‘Petri Leandri industria ex Gallia Plinii
iunioris ad Traianum epistolas licet mancas depravatasque
habuimus! Taken alone these words throw little light on the
sources of this edition, except that they were brought srom
France. The edition was evidently carelessly brought out; it
is full os errors and misspellings, and in particular has all the
Greek words and expressions either incorrectly given or alto-
gether omitted. Later in the same year,l the same forty·six
letters were edited by Beroaldus at Bononia. In this edition
a number of the mistakes made by Avantius are corrected, but
the emendations are all such as might well occur to a sagacious
editor, and there is no sign whatever of any original authority
having been consulted. In 1506 the same letters were pub-
lished for the third time by Catanaeus at Milan, together with
the letters known up to that time of the nine books, His
language in the preface would seem to imply that he had con-
sulted a MS.: ‘Fatear necesse. est primum nobis in animo
fuisse has epistolas intactas relinquere, quia uno tanturn exem-
plari praeter impressa, nec illo admodum vetusto adiuti fuimus?
But both Orelli and Keil are of opinion that his, emendations
are due to his own conjectures only, and it is at any rate
certain that ii he had any MS. before him, it was merely the
same mutilated* copy which Avantius had used four years
before. In 1508, however, was published the first Aldine
edition of Pliny's letters, containing sor the first time the
hitherto missing letters in Book viii (placed now in its right
order before Book ix), and also the first twenty-six letters (accord-
ing to the Avantian numeration,1-4o in my edition) of the
Pliny-Trajan letters He tells us in his letter of dedication to
