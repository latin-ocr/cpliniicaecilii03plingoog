its position, and Pliny had the remonstrances of his friends and
the opposition of the consuls to contend with. However, he
persisted in his intention, and at least with so much' negative

. success, that Certus was disappointed of the consulship to which

he had apparently been designated, and died, as Pliny per-
suaded himself, not long after, from the results of his disap-
pointment and terror.¹ It was under Nerva that Pliny began
the publication, continued during the first half of Trajan's
reign, ofa selection of his correspondence with his friends²
In the last days of the reign he was appointed by Nerua
‘praefectus aerarii Saturni,'³ with his friend Tertullus Cornutus
for his colleague. It was not usual sor the same person to hold
the praefecture of both treasuries in succession, but it is possible
that Pliny's management of the first recommended him, even
contrary to custom, for the second. To the duties of this new
office Pliny devoted himself during the first years of Trajan,
renouncing all his usual practice in the centumviral court;⁴
and when, towards the close of 99 A.D.‚ the proconsuls of Africa
begged the senate to appoint Pliny their advocate against
Marius Priscus, he desired at first to be excused, and it was
only after much persuasion that he consented, and even then
conditionally upon the emperoffs approval, to undertake the
case.⁶ The trial took place in January 100 A.D., under the
presidency of Trajan, who was consul, and ended in the con-

. demnation of Marius.6 But before this result,⁷ Pliny and his

colleague in the aerarium, Tertullus Cornutus, were designated

t by Trajan to a still higher honour, that of 'the consulship,

which they were to hold for the two months of September and,
October. The duties of the consulship were mostly nominal,
and neither Pliny nor his colleague were compelled to lay ⁴
down their post at the treasury.⁸ It fell to Pliny's lot, perhaps as
the senior consul of the two, to move a vote of thanks to the
