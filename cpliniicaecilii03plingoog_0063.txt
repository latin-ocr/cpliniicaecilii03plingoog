sion, he had incautiously, as Pliny puts it, received presents
from the provincials. This was forbidden by the lex Iulia,
and not unnaturally hampered Pliny in his defence. There
must, however, have been other accusations‚ sor the trial lasted
four days. At the end two sentences were proposed (Ι) lege
repetundarum Bassum teneri3 (2) salva dignitate iudices dandos.
The latter, thlough as it was pointed out, ‘non congruens erat
retinere in senatu cui iudices dederis‚' was carried, since as we
have already seen, it was within the power ol the senate, ‘et
mitigare leges et intendere! An attempt was made to get up
an accusation against Theophanes for his conduct oi the case ;
but this, though favoured by a majority vof the senate, was not

countenanced by the consuls. The virtual escape os Bassus Ἰ

was received with great acclamation; we know, however, from
ad Trai. 56 that his acts in the province were rescinded.

Two or three years later, probably in 106 AD, Varenus
Rufus, whom the Bithynians had themselves chosen as one of
their advocates against Bassus was accused by the province
sor acts done in his subsequent proconsulship. The prelimin-
ary inquiry (Plin. Ep. v 20) raised a somewhat important
question, for Varenus demanded that he might be allowed to
compel the attendance of his witnesses· equally with the
accusers. This was no doubt equitable‚ but it was not ‘lege
constitutum‚' and accordingly the granting os his request by
the 'senate can only be ascribed to the partiality which too

κ’ osten marked senatorial justice. This, however, was an act too

patent to be passed unnoticed. The question was broughtup
again without result in the next meeting os the senate by
Licinius Nepos, and the Bithynians even appealed to the
emperor. He, however, true to his policy of conciliation with
the senate, refused to intersere. A new and unexpected aspect
was given to the case before the day sor the trial, for another
legate arrived from the province bringing a ‘decretum consilii,’
by wbich the accusation against Varenus was dropped.
What the cause of this sudden change was we can only guess.
Senatorial influence may have been at work in the province,
and pressure brought to bear on it. At any rate, the previous
legati declined to give up the accusation, and Pliny on his side
declined to defend one who apparently was not accused. The
matter was brought before the emperor for his decision‚ not
