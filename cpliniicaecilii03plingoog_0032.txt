INTRODUCTION 15

result of his annexations would depend chiefly on the policy
pursued by his successors. Genial 3ηά sympathetic, he shared
the trials and dangers of his soldiers as readily as the social
entertainments of the nobihty, while without pretensions to the
higher culture himself, he was a generous patron of literature.
In his civil legislation the meagre information we possess
shows the same benevolence 3ηά equity. The ‘patria potestas’
was modified,1 the interests of minors were consulted‚² exposed
children cared for‚⁸ while the manumission of slaves was
rendered more easy.4 The spirit ol hiscriminal legislationis
summed up in the maxim that it is better for a guilty person

liuthardus-The original authorities are exceptionally
scanty. The abridgment of Dio Cassius by Xiphilinus
(Book 68) is the most valuable, though its chronology is

confused and the facts meagre. Pliuy’s ‘Panegyric‚’ though

no doubt exaggerated and needing qualification gives some
valuable information with regard to the first three years of the
reign. His letters contain numerous allusions, which are, how·
ever, frequently obscure, except where light is ’ thrown upon
them from other sources. Eutropius devotes achapter of Book
viii and Aurelius Victor two chapters (Caes. 13, Epit. 13) to
the reign. For the Parthian wars these authorities are supple·
mented by Juuuues Malalas.

The inscriptions and medals relating to Trajan’s reign are
fortunately very numerous. For the former see the Corpus
Inscriptionum Latinarum ,· for the latter Eckhel, ‘Doctrina
Numorum Veterum‚’ and Cohen, ‘Monnaies Impdriales,' vol. ii.
Among modern writerS, J. Aug. Bach has collected all the pass·
ages in the Digest relating to Trajan, ‘Divus Traianus sive de
legibus Traiani imperatoris,' Leipsic, 174 73 Marmest has written
on the Dacian wars, ‘Res Traiani imperatoris ad Danubium
gestae‚' 1793. Henri Francke's ‘Zur Geschichte Trajans und
seiner Zeitgenossen,’ Giistrow, 1837, is now superseded by
Dierauer's ‘Beitrage zu einer Kritischen Geschichte Trajans,’
