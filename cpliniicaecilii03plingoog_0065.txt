the anarchy‚ factions, and financial mismanagement of these
so-called free and allied communities. Pliny, in his letter of
advice to Maximus calls the mission a legati0, and no doubt
for the time Achaia was under him as legatus Caesaris, instead
of under a proconsul. Another instance of the same sort is
seen in Wilmann, 874, where we lind that Avidius Nigrinus,
described as ‘legatus Augusti pro praetore‚' settles a boundary
dispute between the peoples of Anticyra and Delphi. From
his title of legatus, we must assume that he was sent on a
similar mission 'to that of Maximus The next and a more
important case is that of Bithynia, which under senatorial
administration had already become disorganised. Its linanees
were in great disorder3 it was apparently subject to turbulence
and faction owing to the existence of unregulated collegia, and
there seems to have been little supervision on the part of the
municipal authorities over contracts and contractors of public
works. Two long and complicated cases of repetundae within
four or five years also point to the need for a decisive reform.

f The case of Varenus, it will be remembered, had ended in a

promise, on the part of the emperor, ‘explorare provincialium
voluntatem' Possibly in the fulfilment of this promise, Trajan

may have found that the disorganisation was too deep and
widespread to be remedied by any more trials under the lex

repetundarum, and in choosing a special commissioner to carry
out necessary reforms, no one would seem more fitted for the
post than Pliny, wh0, though he had held no provincial gover-
norship, had obtained a certain reputation from undertaking
the cause of Africa and Baetica, and waS, in particular, ac-
quainted with Bithynian affairs from the part he had taken in
the two recent trials. From the well-known inscription of
Pliny (see p. 16), we know that his title was ‘legatus pro
praetore provinciae Ponti et Bithyniae consulari potestate ex

senatus consulto missus ab imperatore Caesare Nerva Traiano,' Α

etc. etc, Like Maximus and Nigrinus therefore, he was
‘legatus Augusti,' and therefore necessarily, as we have seen,
pro praetore3 but in order that he might not, by having only
five fasces seem to the provincials a less important personage
than their ordinary proconsuls, the ‘consularis potestas' was
quite exceptionally added, which would give him the privilege
of six fasces, while, to save the authority of the senate over its
