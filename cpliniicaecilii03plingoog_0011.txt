inductively srom so many different sources in Mommsen's
Staatsreclrt, should be applied sometimes so to speak‚
deductively to illustrate particular authors, lt was with
this view that l selected Pliny's correspondence with
. Trajan, as offering a most suitable and at the same time
hitherto unworked material lor this purpose. To illustrate
the various points, all the side-lights possible have been
thrown lrom other authors, lrom InscriptionS, and not
least lrom the Digest. For avery large number ol these
Α Ι am indebted to Mommsen’s and Marquadt’s Hand-
bucher der Rdmzsclzen Α ltertlntmem lor a lew, as l have
acknowledged elsewhere, to Db'ring's edition ol the
Letters. lt is hoped that the text, based ona comparison
ol the original editions, with the additional help afforded
by the Bodleian MS, will in some passages be found an
improvement on Keil's. The book is not primarily
intended lor school use. Pliny is indeed far too little read
in schools generally, and perhaps the ‘literae inlitera-
tissimae' ol this correspondence would be considered less
suitable as an introduction to that author than some one
os the other books of the collection. At the same time,
if it is not to remain a law of the Medes and Persians that
sor school purposes Roman history should end with
Augustus, Ι should venture to express the opinion that
the portion of a school term which would be necessary sor
the mastering of 'these Letters with all their details by a
sixth form, would be time not uselessly spent. Ι hope
shortly to submit to a similar treatment, though in a
manner and ‘within a range more directly suitable lor
school use, Plutarch’s lives os Galba and Otho,
