The date of this letter depends on the Nor did Pliny stand alone. A similar

question whether Caecilius Classicus was bequest for his freedmen is found in the

accused in 99 or ror. Cf. Ep. iii 4, 2.
‘Cum publicum opus pecunia mea incho-
aturus in Tuscos excucurrissem accepto,
ut praefectus aerari, commeatu, legati,
provinciae Baeticae questuri de procon-
sulatu Caecili Classici advocatum me a
senatu petierunt’ See mpra note on
Ep. 3 δ 2 p. 83. If we decide with
Mommsen, the letter⁴ was written in
August 101. ’

honestissimo exemplo. Instances
of Nerva’s public munificence are (1) the
institution oi the alimentationes in Italian
towns, testified to byAurelius Victor,
Epit. c. xii, and coins (Eckhel, vi p. 408,
and Cohen, No. 121) with legend ‘Tutela
itallae’ and figures of a woman and child
coming before the emperor. See intro·
duction p. 103 (2) provision for the corn
supply (Echkel, vi p. 408, has coins with
legend ‘Plebei urbanae fruniento con·-
stituto'); (3) the purchase of land for
poor citizens, Dio Cass. 68, 2; (4) the
completion of the Forum transitorium
begun by Domitian; and of the temple
of Minerva. Suet. Dom. 53 Aur. -Vict
Epir. xii; Mart. i 3, 10.

The example of Nerva was not only
followed by Trajan and his successors,
in connection with the ‘alimentationes'
(see introd. p. 10), and the Tabulae of
Veleia and Ligures Baebiani, but also bya

’ number of private individuals. Pliny

himself, in addition to the temple men-
tioned in the present letter, founded (1)
a library in Comum,i 8, 2 (though this
was under Domitian) ; (2) an endowment
of 500,οω sesterces for the education
of boys and girls in Comum,i 8, 103
i5 3 and vii 18, 23 (3) he offers to pay

the third part of the salary of a professor

of rhetoric at Comum, i the town will
provide the rest, iii 13, 53 (4) repairs a
temple of Ceres near one of his estates, ix
39, 13 (5) by his will Thermae were to
be established at Comum, and a capital
sum of 300,000 sesterces set apart as an
endowment for their internal mainten-
ance, and 200,ooo for repalrs, eto, in·

10 municipium. See iv i, 4, ‘oppid-
um est praediis nostris vicinum; nomen
Tiferni Tiberini, quod me paene adhuc
puerum patronum cooptavit.' Tifernum
Tiberinum was a town inUmbria near
the head waters of the Tiber. It was so
called to distinguish it from Tifernum
Metaurense, also in Umbria, but on the
Metaurus: see Plin. Nat. He'st. iii 5.

adiecta sue statua. Nerva was not
as fond as some emperors of having
statues erected in their honour, and
golden statues he altogetherforbade.

τας αὐτῷ χρυσοῦς γίγνεσθαι] ’ ,

oum plenissimo testimonio. On ‘
another occasion also Nerva had borne
witness to Pliny’s merite. See vii 33.
In 93, when Baebius Massa bad been con-
demned, and his goods were to be
publicly guarded, there seemed some
probability that the consuls, possibly
with the connivance of Domitian, would
execute this part of the sentence some·
what¹ laxly. Senecio aad Pliny, therefore,
the two accusers, went to the consuls 00
the subject, when Massa accused Senecio
of impiety towards the emperor. Pliny
