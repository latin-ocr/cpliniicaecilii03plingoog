EPISTULARUM LXVI

175

tractata est, nec quicquam invenitur in commentariis eorum
principum qui ante me fuerunt, quod ad omnes provincias sit
constitutum. Epistulae sane sunt Domitiani ad Avidium Nigri·
num et Armenium Brocchum, quae fortasse debeant observari:

decision of my predecessors is found
which was intended to apply to all pro·
vinces. ἕ 2. Possibly the letters of Domi-
tian to Nigrinus and Brocchus ought to be
observed, but among the provinces men·
tioned in these rescripta Bithynia is not
included. 1 am therefore of opinion that
those who wish to be emancipated on
this account should not be prevented
from making a public declaration of their
freedom, and that it is not necessary for
them to purchase their freedom by the
repayment of their maintenance.

§a in commentariis. See note on
Ep. 105.

quod ad omnes provincias eit
constitutum. Whereverthe local custom
was clear and well defined, it would be
recognised and sanctioned by imperial
constitution, but in Bithynia, where
neither local custom nor imperial rescript
could be cited, Trajan could make his
decision unhampered.

§a Epistulae sane sunt Domit. etc.
Trajanmentionsthoseparticularlybecause,
though they were not written in reference
to all provinces, yet they, unlike the other
letters to a particular town, did apply to
the whole of some one province, ap·
parently indeed to more than one.

sed intre ees provincias de quibus
rescripsit. lhave adopted Keil's con·
jecture, which involves least departure
from the reading of Avantins who read
‘inter quas est Bithynia ’3 which Aldus
altered into ‘non est Bithynia,’ omitting
‘inter quas’ Mommsen suggests ‘prae-
terita est Bithynia! Domitian, while
writing to these two proconsuls of Achaia,
seems to have mentioned certain other
provinces to which his ruling applied.

neo assertionem denegandam.
This is the answer to the question ‘de
conditione.' A disputed case of freedom
was called a ‘causa liberalis' See Cod.
lust. vii 17. Α person who claimed his
freedom could make his adsertio only
through a representative (adsertor) Mart.
i 53, who as in the process of vindicatio
had to touch the claimant with his hand
(manu adserere). The term ‘adsertio,’
however, had two applications: ‘adsertio
tarn a servitate in libertatem quam a

libertate in servitium trahi signifieat‚’
Prisc. p. 1208 Ρ., and Livy. iii 44, ‘ut
virginem in servitutem adsereret‚'cf. Suet.
Dom. 8, id. Aug. 74, id. Vitell. 10, ‘qui
non contenti epulo ubique publice prae·
bito, quoscunque libuisset, ur libertatem
adserebant.’

, The adsertor was usually, though not

necessarily,a relation. Cf. Suet. Vesp.
3, and an interesting case in De illustribus
grammaticis, c. 21, ‘C. Melissus Spoleti
natus, ingenuus, sed ob discordiam
parentum expositus, cura et industria
educatoris sui altiora studia percepit: ac
Maecenati pro grammatico datus est
muneri. Cui quum se gratum et acceptum
in modum amici videret, quamquam
adserente matre, permansit tamen in statu
servitutis!

in libertatem vindicabuntur. In
the ‘causae liberales’ there were an
‘adsertor libertatis’ and an ‘adsertor
servitutis’; Gaius, iv 16, gives the legal
formulae used, ‘hunc ego hominem ex iure
Quiritium meum esse aio secundum suam
causam sicut dixi. Ecce tibi vindictam
imposui’ The other side repeated the
same words, and the praetor gave the
order ‘ Mittite ambo hominem.¹ Pending
the decision of the case the ‘vindiciae
were according to the XII Tables given
‘secundum libertatenr,’ ae. the claimant
provisionally retained his freedom. Cf
the case oi Virginia, Livy, iii 44, sq. ;
Dz'g. 1, 2, 24; Cicda Rep. iii 32. The
phrase ⁶ in libertatem vindicare' is also
used popularly apart from its legal sense,
cf. Cic. ad Fam. ii 5, 2, ‘rempublicam
in libertatem vindicare! Caes. Bell Gall.
vii 1, ‘Galliam in lib. vind.'

neque ipsam libertatem redi-
mendam pretio alimentorum. This
answers the question ‘de alimentis’
Trajan’s decision is equitable in itself, but
to a certain extent would serve to dis·
courage the habit of rescuing exposed
children Possibly, as De la Berge
suggests, Trajan may have had a scheme
ior charging the several towns with the
maintenance of such children, or possibly
he proposed to institute in the provinces
‘alimentationes ’ similar to those in Italy.
However, Trajan's decision was reversed
