De pecunia finoris

C. PLINIUS TRAIANO IMPERATORI

Pecuniae publicae, domine, providentia tua et ministerio
nostro et iam exactae sunt et exiguntur ; quae vereor ne otiosae
iaceant. Nam et praediorum conparandorum aut nulla aut ra·
rissima occasio est, nec inveniuntur qui velint debere rei publicae,
praesertim (duodenis assibus), quanti a privatis mutuantur.

usuris assibus, Gramm'us.

ξ 1. The money owing to the towns,
sire, has either been called in, oris in the
act os being so. I arn only afraid lest it
should remain uninvested. There are
lew opportunities ol urchasing land, nor
are borrowers os tle public sunds to
be found, at 12 per cent, the private
rate oi interest. §a Would it not be
well to lower the rate os interest, and so
attract suitable borrowers, or if that
course alsosails, to compel the decuriones
to borrow the money in equal shares,
upon their giving proper security? Even
if they have to borrow against their will,
this will be less ol a hardship if the rate
of interest is lowered.

publicae pecuniae, etc. Cf. Ep. 17,
‘multae enim pecuniae variis ex causis
a privatis detinentur,' and Ep. 23, ‘erit
enim pecunia ex qua fiat primum ea quarn
revocare a privatis et exigere iarn coepi’

tua providentia. Cf. supra, Ep. 43,
2, ‘memor propositi tui.'

otiosae. Cf. the phrase ‘pecuniam
occupare,' Cic. pro Flacc. 21, 513 id.
Vcrr. 2, 15 36, 91. Cs. Quint. Declam.
345, ‘pecuniam dedi etex otiosa iacente
patrimonii parte aliquid numeravi!

nam et praediorum conparan-
dorum aut nulla, etc. There was one
good opportunity in Trajan’s reign. Cf.
Plin. Ep. vi 19, 6, ‘hoc vendendi tempus
(zie. in Italy) tarn Hercule quam in pro-
vinciis comparandi, dum idem candidati
illic vendunt, ut hic emant'

praesertim duodenis assibus.
These words present considerable diffi-
· culty, because from the time os Sulla on·
ward, interest was reckoned by the
month and not by the year. Marquadt

mutuantur, B. and Αἶά.
muniantur, Avant.

can only quote a single unmistakable
instance ot the latter. Henz. 7215,
‘usuras totius anni computatas octono
pemumerabo‚' zie. 12} per cent. At the
end of the republican period the normal
rate os interest owing to the rapid acquisi-
tion os large capitals was as low as 4
per cent, though it suddenly rose to 8
per cent. Cic. ad Att. iv 15, 7, ‘fenus
ex triente Idib. Quint. facturn erat bes·
sibus.' In the provinces it was often
considerably more. Verres extorted 24
per cent in Sicily3 Brutus 48 per cent in ⁶
Cyprus; and Cicero in his edict sor
Cilicia made 12 per cent the maximum
rate. This from the time of the early
empire seems to have been the normal
rate, although Persius v 150, speaks oi 11
per centas‘avidos deunces.’ Twelve per
oent was ‘centesimae usurae,’ or ‘cen-
tesima pars sortis,' and this is no doubt
the interest about which Pliny is speak-
ing here. ‘Duodenis assibus,’ however,
can only mean 12 per cent, iithe interest
os the whole year is calculated. Whether
this was ever done, and whether ‘asses
usurae ’ may not mean 1 per cent, instead
of being regarded as equivalent to cen·
tesimae usurae, appears uncertain. Sal·
masius and Gronovius at any rate do not
take this view, and read here ‘usuris
assibus) Much more satisfactory, if an

alteration must be made, seems to bel
A. Ernesti's omission of the two words
altogether. Right or wrong, the words
seem hardly wanted, as ir 12 per cent
was the normal rate, it was hardly
necessary for Pliny to mention it. See
Marquadt, Staatsvem xi pp. 60, 61.
