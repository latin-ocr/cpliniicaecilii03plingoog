supposed, have been deaconesses; at any
rate, it is clear that they were, or that
Pliny believed them to be, slaves—al·
though slaves, as a rule, might not be
examined against their masters. Ulpian
lays it down, lib. viii, De officio Procons.

There, however, Christianity was a pro·
minent feature in the province ; and it is
to the creditos Pliny that, while he did
not shrink stom punishing the Christians
for their obstinacy, he t'reely confesses
that as iar as his inquiries had gone they

than the jurists, who laid it down ‘gras-

Christians, cf. what Tertullian says to
Scapula, the governor ol Carthage:

This gives an idea of the number o'
Christians in Bithynia at this time, and
explains the action ol the government,
which, however it might tolerate other
cults, could not allow the state worship
to be impaired. It was the proselytising ’
tendency os both Judaism and Christian·
ity which probably brought them first
into collision with the authorities. Dur-

pastumque venire victimarum.
Just as the trade of the siber-shrine
makers at Ephesus was endangered by
the increase of Christianity caused by
Paul’s preaching, so in Bithynia the
sarmers who brought into the various
markets sood i'or the temple victims were
in danger oi' being ruined. Pn'vate per- ,

to suppose with Orelli that there is any
allusion here to contracts sor supplying
