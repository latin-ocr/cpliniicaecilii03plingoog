2 Potest enim lacus fossa usque ad flumen adduci nec tamen
in flumen emitti, sed relicto quasi margine contineri pariter
et dirimi. Sic consequemur ut nec vicino videatur flumini
mixtus et sit perinde ac si misceatur. Erit enim facile per
illam brevissimam terram quae interiacebit advecta fossa onera
3 transponere in flumen. Quod ita fiet, si necessitas coget, et,
spero, non coget. Est enirn et lacus ipse satis altus et nunc in
contrariam partem flumen emittit, quod interclusum inde et quo

would be easy to transport goods across
from one to the other. ἓ 3. But I hope
there will be no necessity sor this, ior the
lake is sufficiently deep, and as it is, has
a river flowing out of it on its other side.
This we can dam up and divert in any
direction we please, so that the lake will
still send out precisely as much water as
it does now. Besides, there are a number
oi streams along the course of the pro·
posed canal‚ and if the water from these
is collected, it will quite make up for
what the lake loses. §4 Or ii it should
seem advisable to make the canal longer

¹ and narrower and to connect it im-

mediately with the sea, the flow oi the
tide will check the drain oi water from
the lake. But even ii there were no such
natural checks, it would he easy to replace
them by <lanis and weirs. ἓ 5. However,
your librator will be better able to decide
these points. Pray do not iorget your
promise to send one. ·The work is quite
worthy your attention. Meanwhile I
