INTRODUCTJON 11

governor, but tas the custom became the rule rather than the exception,
the advantages of self- -tgovernmen were lost, and the feeling of municipal
responsibility lessened In other respects Trajan’s care for Italy
showed itself in more unimpeachable ways. The roads were every·
where restored,1 bridges built,2 the Fontine marshes made passable,⁸
while a new road was constructed at Trajan's own expense from Bene

ventum to Brundisium! While internal communications in Italy were

thus facilitated, its foreign trade was assisted by the enlargement of
the harbour at Ostia, where a new and larger basin was added to that
of Claudius and connected with the Tiber by a new canal.⁶ Another
harbour was made at Centum Cellae (Civita Vecchia), begun shortly
after the second Dacian war,⁶ while a third was constructed on the
east coast at Ancona, as the inscription on Trajan's triumphal arch
there recordsss Instances of a similar care for the provinces are the
bridge at Alcantara over the Tagus,8 and the restoration of the canal
between Bubastis and Arsinoe by means of which the products of the
porphyry quarries could be conveyed to the Mediterranean.⁹ Of
Trajan's splendid forum in Rome, probably finished in 112, with its
basilica and libraries, and above all the noble column which still stands
erect, nothing need here be said, but the restoration of the Aqua
Marcia, and the construction of the new Aqua Traiana proves that in
his building as in his other public acts, he sought the well-being of his
people.

Of Trajan's provincial administration we seem at first sight
to have a peculiar means of judging from the correspondence
with Pliny. This, on examination, however, turns out to be
at least partiallydelusive. Bithynia under senatorial govern-
ment had been allowed to fall into a state of great disorganisa-
ῖίοη,10 the finances were in disorder,11 public buildings dilapi-
dated,²² and at least two of the governors had recently been
accused of ‘repetundae’ 1³ It was thus to meet a specilic and
temporary need that Pliny, who had gained some knowledge
of Bithynian affairs by his part in the actions against Bassus
and Varenus was in 111 AD.14 sent out on a special mission1⁵
by Trajan to restore order. 2The correspondence therefore
