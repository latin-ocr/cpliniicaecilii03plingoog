40 INTRODUCTJON

iudices, In addition to this common penalty lor all convictionS,
there might be a pecuniary reimbursement, viz. the quadruple
amount of the money wrongfully exacted, while in more serious
cases the various grades of banishment might be inflicted either
‘in tempus' or ‘in perpetuum,’ not even stopping short ol de·
portatio with its complete infamia and confiscation of property.

But apart srom any mitigation on the part of the emperor,
the senate as a deliberative as well as a judicial body, was not
strictly bound down to any hard-and-fast lines and gradations ⁴
of punishment. In certain cases they could mitigate the
penalty, in others they could intensiiy it (Plin. Ep. iv 9, 17),
‘licet mitigare leges et intendere ;'’ and we know several instances ·
in which they availed themselves of this elasticity‚ not always
perhaps in the interests of justice or equity.

Turning to our authorities we find that advantage was
taken by the provinces with some frequency os this means of
obtaining compensation for the oppression os bad or corrupt
governors. That Tiberius continued in regard to the provinces,
as in other matters, the policy laid down by Augustus we know
from several passages of Tacitus; he prevented new burdenS‚
and provided against the avarice and cruelty of the magistrates
(Arm. iv 6); he assisted particular states in cases of emergency,
by a temporary remission of tribute (Arm. iv 13, and ii 47),
while there were in his reign eight cases of provincial governors ·
being accused of mal-administration.

(1) Tac. Arm. i 74. Granius Marcellus, proconsul of Bithynia,
was accused by his own quaestor both of maiestas
and repetundae. Aequitted of the former charge, he
was sent before recuperatores sor the latter, and in con-
sequence degraded.

(2) Arm. iii 38. Caesius Cordus, proconsul of Crete, was
accused of repetundae by Ancharius Priscus a delator,
and condemned.

(3) Arm. iii 66. C. Silanus proconsul of Asia, was accused
by the provincials and condemned, and in gratitude ⁰
for this ‘decrevere Asiae urbes templum Tiberio)

(4) Arm. iv 13. Vibius Serenus, proconsul of Hispania
ulterior, was accused and condemned, ‘de vi publica’
and banished (deportatus) to the island of Amorgos
