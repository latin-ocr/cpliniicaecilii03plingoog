such cases were tried. As Mommsen has pointed out (Stam-
reclzt, ii 112) the senatorial tribunal tried various and miscellan·
eous charges, and criminals of every rank and order, but still
it was more especially a court for political or official offenders
, of senatorial rank. Charges against provincial governors might
be made by a province as a whole represented by its consilium
(Plin. Ep. iii 9, 4) by separate communities in a province (id. ib.)
by individual provincials or by some subordinate official 01
the governor himself (Tac. Arm. xii 59). ln any case the
accuser had to come before the consuls in the first instance
with his accusation to demand that it might be heard (Tac.
Arm. ii 283 xiii 44). This occasioned a preliminary hearing,
as the result of which the senate either decided to try the
charge itself in the Curia, in which case the consul would pre-
side, and the rule of procedure would be the same as in the
quaestiones (Plin. Ep. iii 11), or if it was a mere case for pecuniary
reimbursement, the senate might, if it chose, pass it over to
the quaestio de repetundis or iudices (Plin. Ep. iii 11 ; iv 9), or
recuperatores (Tac. Anu. i743 Suet. Dom. 8), or if the case .
seemed too complex or too invidious, they might request the
emperor himself to undertake it3 this, however, was seldom or
never granted, though the emperor might preside as consul in
the senatorial court. He occasionally also by his tribunician
veto either prevented a trial from taking place (Tac. Arm. iii
70), or hindered the execution of the punishment pronounced
(Tac. Amr. xiv 48). If the senate undertook the hearing of the
case, it designated members of its own body both to accuse
and to defend, drawing lots apparently among a'certain num-
ber of names in each case. If, however, the provincials

wished for any particular advocate, their wishes appear to have J

been *for the most part consulted (Plin. Ep. iii 4, 3), while pro-
vincial advocates took part in the trial along with the senatorial
pleaders. A certain advantage was conceded to the accuser
by making the attendance of his witnesses compulsory, while
the defendant had to secure the presence of his as he could.
Conviction under the charge of repetundae always and necessarily ’
involved partial infamia, ie. expulsion from the senate and
loss of official dignity.

This was ipso facto involved in the preliminary decision
of the senate that the case should be handed over to the
