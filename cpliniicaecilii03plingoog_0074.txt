INTRODUCTION 57

One os the results of the Jewish war could hardly fail to be
increased watchfulness on the part of the Roman government
against all violent, secret, or growing superstitious. The
supremacy of the state religion would be more consciously
asserted, and though the principle of toleration for Judaism was
probably not directly modified, it would not unreasonably be
limited to Judaism as a national religion, and would not be
extended either to it or to any of its offshoots which gave
symptoms of being cosmopolitan rather than national. But,
along with this changing attitude of the Roman government it
is impossible to doubt that Christianity after the destruction of
the Temple developed rapidly both in numbers and organisation.
As to the provinces we have no information dating from
Domitian's reign, and whether the Christians were then intersered
with or not, we cannot tell. Under the lax rlgz‘me of the
senatorial provinces they may well have escaped notice, especially
if they consented to pay the two drachmae tribute, while in the
imperial province of Syria they may probably have still been
undistinguished from the Jews. At Rome, too, as long as their
converts belonged to the lower classes as sor the most part they
certainly did, they might still escape notice, though they might
share in the sentence of expulsion from Rome which Domitian
on one occasion passed upon the Jews But is any converts of
rank or importance were made, the affair would become altogether
different, the state religion would be encroached upon, and the
converts, through their actual or inferred denial of the state
deities, would be accused of impiety and atheism-charges which
might easily be brought under that of maiestas. This is perhaps
what took place at the end of Domitian’s reign, at a time when'
there was still no clear distinction in Roman minds between
the Jews and the Christians. The persecution, if such it was,
would be no doubt to the Christian writers aChristian persecu-
tion. ln the Greek text of the Clzronicles of Eusebius Clemens ·
is distinctly claimed as a Christian martyr, while an elaborate
legend grew up round the names os Nereus, and Achilleus,
two sreedmen of a younger Domitilla. On the other hand, amid
the confused ideas of the time, Dio Cassius may well have ¹
followed some version which spoke oi the victims as Jews, and
not as Christians. ln any ease, no doubt when attention was
once directed to the matter the numerous delatores os the time
