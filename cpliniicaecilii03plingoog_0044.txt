of the literary dilettanteism of the time, was probably not too
common. There was no school at Comum, and boys, in con·
sequence, had to be sentito< Mediolanum. To remedy this
defect, Pliny offered himself to pay one-third of the salary
required sor a competent teacher, and would have defrayed the
whole expense but for a conviction that the parents ought not
to be relieved of all responsibility.¹ , Besides this, we know from
a letter to Calvisius Rufus² that Pliny had contributed to the
needs of his native town no less than 1,600,000 sesterces.
Of these, 500,000 were for the maintenance os a number of
plebeian boys and girls,3 which, in order to make the bequest a
secure one, Pliny handed over to the municipal authorities, in
the form of a mortgage on one of his estates, amounting to an
annual payment of 30,000 sesterces.4 Another not less
important boon conferred on the town was atpublic library,⁵
which Pliny built at an expense of 1‚000,000 sesterces and

of the emperors, including Nerva and Trajan,8 while on another
of his estates he rebuilt a dilapidated temple of Ceres added
two colonnades and a new statue of the goddess in marble to

a sum of money for the construction os some thermae at Comum,

as well as for their suitable adornment and maintenance, and
also a sum of 1,866,666 sesterces for the maintenance ofa
hundred ot' his freedmen, after whose decease the money was to
be used for a public banquet to the people.1⁰ But it was not
only with his purse that Pliny helped his friends. His influence
was always at their service. For some he obtained the ‘latus
clavus’ ; ²¹ for others the ‘ius trium liberorum,’ 1² or a military
tribuneship,¹³ or the post of centurion.14 For his friend Sura he
sought to obtain the praetorship from Trajan ;15 and in fact
he was always ready to canvass for his friends, and 'always
