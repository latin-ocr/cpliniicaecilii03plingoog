thereupon said, ‘Sed vereor, clarissimi
consules, ne mihi Massa silentio sno
praevaricationem obiecerit, quod non et

decurtontbus. The decurions or
conscripti (lex Iul. Municrp, line 85), less
frequently senatores (Tac. Hist. v 19), or
collectively ordo decurionum, or ordo
alone (Tac. Hist. ii 52 ordo Mutinensis)
and in later times curiales (Orelli, 3729),
were the senate in all towns of Italian
constitution not only in Italy itself, but in
the provinces. Cf. infra Ep. 113and1153
and Orelli 4980, ‘decurio civium Romano-
rum Mogontiaci.’ They were usually 100
in number (Cic. de leg. agrar. 2, 35,
96), and are sometimes called centumviri.
Orelli, 3448, 3739. Se’e also the album
of Canusium referred to below, Under
the empire election to the ‘urdo’ took
Ellieeliilfifssnlilissuiiiiihiuiu‘lliil
to prepare< tfhe‘ albuin’ (lex sulib Mun.
ad inin). Election to any vacancies
was made (1) from those who were quali-
fied through having held the quaestorship
or any of the higber magistracies; (2)fr0m
those who, though not yet elected magis-
trates, have the necessary qualifications,
and also the senatorial census. These
latter when elected were called ‘pedani'
The others were arranged in the album
according to the dignity of the offices
they had held, ας, ag. quinquennalicii,
duoviralicii, aedilicii, quaestoricii. In
addition to these ordinary classes, per·
sons without any of these qualifications,
but who had performed some special

· service to the community‚ were some·

times added to the ordo either by the
decuriones themselves, or even by the
emperor. These were called adlecti
(Cf. Suet. Claud. 24 and Vespas. 9, for
this use of the word adlego), and they
itllrffiilybreneififibfigdin Thirso‘sadllgctiliriigi
duoviralicios, etc! So Pliny, speaking
of the Roman senate, Ep. i 14, 5, says,
‘Minucius Macrinus equestris ordinis
princeps adlectus a divo Vespasiano inter
praetorios.’ To these various classes

who all voted and were included in the
hundred, there were two other classes, who
are added to the album, and who might
be present at meetings of the ordo, but
were only honorary or formal members.
There were—(1) the patroni, rie. Roman
senators or equites appointed patroni by
the local senate. These were placed
first in the album, Drg. 5ο, 3, 2, ‘In
albo decurionum in municipio nomina
ante-scribi oportet eorum qui dignitates
principis iudicio consecuti sunt, postea
eorum, qui tanturn municipalibus honori-
bus functi sunt;’ (2) the praetextati or
sons of the senators who were allowed to
be present, but had no vote. Thus in
the Album Canusinam (Orelli, 3721)
there are thirty-one patroni c.c.v.v.
(clarissimi vrrrl, eight patroni e. e.q.q. R.R.
(equites Romani), seven quinquenna-
licri, four adlecti inter quinquen, twenty-
nine duoviralicii, nineteen aedilicii, nine
quaestoricii, thirty-two pedani, twenty·
five praetextati, rie. 164 in all, but ex-
actly 100 when the patroni and prae-
textati are subtracted. Pliny was
himself a patronus ol Tifernum, pro·
bably an hereditary one, as he was
appointed when a boy, ‘quod me paene
adhuc puerum patronum cooptavit,’ and
was therefore on the album decurionum
of the town. For the change in the
position of the decuriones in later times
see note on Ep. 113.

ut adsignarent solum ln quo
temptum pecunia mea extruerem.
The abbreviations L.D.D.D. loco dato
decreto decurionum, and D.S.P. de sua
pecunia are very common on dedicatory
inscriptions. The following is an inter·
esting one, and bears a close resemblance
to what Pliny’s dedication may have
been at Tifernum. Wilmann, 307.
