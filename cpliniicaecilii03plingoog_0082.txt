regard the danger of Christianity as serious and it was only
when, as he says, ‘i so tractatu diffundente se crimine plures
species inciderunt’ffiat he felt himself in a difficulty, and
inquired, and this ater all was the gist of his letter, whether it
would not be better to give the accused an opportunity of
recantation, which, though contrary to the principles of Roman
law, seemed the most expedient course in the circumstances. ]

AUTHORITIES FOR THE TEXT

Up to the year 1502, although no less than five editions
of Pliny's letters had been published in Italy, his correspond-
ence with Trajan was altogether unknown, and in spite of
allusions in Tertullian, Eusebius or Orosius, apparently un·
suspected. Of the four families into which Keil, in the preface
to his critical edition of 1870, divides the MSS. of Pliny,
members of three only had up to that time been discovered;
¹(1) those containing the first four Books and six letters of
Book V, and represented by the Codex Florentinus; (2) those,
dating mostly from the fifteenth century, which contain eight
books, the eighth being omitted, and Book ix, minus letter
16, inscribed as Book viii. This family is best represented by
the Codex Dresdensis (3), a family containing nine books.
The most complete representative of this family, the Codex
Mediceus,was not brought to Italy till 1508, and was not
used for any edition of Pliny till the second edition of Catanaeus
in 15183 but the Roman edition of the letters published in
1474 contained some of the letters of Book viii, and must
have been based on some unknown and imperfect member of
this family. Based on some or other of these MSS. then, there
had appeared-(1) the editio princeps, in 1471; (2) the
Roman edition in 1474 ; (3) a Neapolitan edition in 1476;
(4) the edition of Pomponius Laetus in >14903 and (5) the
edition of Beroaldus in 1498. The Pliny-Trajan letters
appeared in none of these editions, which also wanted Ep. 16
of ix; and in Book viii, Epp. 8, ᾖ 3—18,§ 11. But in May
of 1502 Hieronymus Avantius of Verona, who had previously
edited Sallust's Catiline for the Aldine Press, brought out ‘C.
