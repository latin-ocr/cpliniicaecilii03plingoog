JNTRODUCTJON 31

governor before the senate, but there were so many difficulties,
so many hindrances, and so uncertain a prospectos success that
they may well have hesitated, as Juvenal says, ‘post omnia .
perdere naulum.³ For at the outset they would have to appeal
to the patroni of the province, before they could have any
locus standi at all, and these patroni, senators themselves, and
perhaps expectant govemors, were often reluctant to give their
assistance. Even if they did, or if the province found, as
Sicily did in Cicero, some one else willing to undertake their
cause, there was still unlimited bribery to contend with, an
unfriendly tribunal to be looked for, and difficulties of every
kind thrown in their way, sometimes even by the successor of the
prosecuted governor, who might, if he chose, prevent or delay
the provincial legates and witnesseS, whose presence the case
demanded at Rome.

Stillsome nominal check there was, and the public opinion
on the subject to a certain extent was a growing one. Previous
to 149 Rc. complaints were either heard by the senate itself
(Livy, 26, 2 5 3 38, 243 38,43); or handed over to the consuls, and
acommission (Livy, 29, 163 39, 3 ; 43, 2); or even sent before the
ι comitia tributa (Livy, 29, 163 43, 8). In that year, however,
an attempt was made at a more definite procedure by the lex
Calpurnia, which established the first of the quaestiones per·
petuae, viz. that ‘de pecuniis repetundis’ (Cic. pro Cluent. 5 3 ;
de Off. ii 213 Brut. 273 Tac. Aren. xv 20). By this law
the various offences which it was designed to check were
enumerated (Cic. de Leg. iii 20). An initial appeal to the
senate'was rendered unnecessary, and the procedure before the ἵ
senatorial iudices presided over by the praetor peregrinus was ·
fixed. This law was for the protection of peregrini, zie. pro·
vincials only, as Cicero expressly states (Div. 5): ‘quasi vero
dubium sit quia· tota lex depecuniis repetundis sociorum
causa constituta sit' (conf. Verr. ii 6). The punishment,
however, was apparently at present only pecuniary, and con·
sisted in simple reimbursement, and the trial was therefore
merely recuperatorial. This law was followed, modified, or ’
supplemented by others, such as the lex Servilia, 106 B.C., the
lex Acilia, 101 B.C., and the lex Cornelia, 81 Rc. By thelex
Servilia, of which the lex Acilia seems to have been amere
repetition, all magistrates 'and even equites might be'accused.
