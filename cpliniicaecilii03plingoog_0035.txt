18 INTRODUCTION

guardian so influential as Verginius Rufus, and possessed of so
much hereditary wealth and local prestige, the young Pliny
was naturally marked out for a more than municipal career,
and he was accordingly sent to Rome to finish his education.
There he attended the lectures of Nicetes Sacerdos a celebrated
rhetorician from Smyrna,1 and also of the stillmore famous
· Quintilian,² who was appointed to a chair of rhetoric iu Rome
by Vespasian. But the zeal and enthusiasm for study which
was so 'marked a feature in Pliny, as we know him in his
maturity, was doubtless derived to a great extent from his
intercourse with his maternal uncle, C. Plinius Secundus, who'
after having passed through several grades of the equestrian
career,³ had since the last years of Nero’s reign devoted him-
self mainly to a life of study. In 79 AD, however, he was
praefect of the fleet at Misenum,4 and Pliny and his mother
were staying with him there in August of that year at the time
when the eruption of Vesuvius took place. An interesting
account of that event, and of the death of ‘his uncle, which was ·
caused by it, is given by Pliny to Tacitus.⁵ From this time
Pliny appears under the name by which he is generally known.
By his uncle's will he was adopted as his son,6 and therefore
became a member of the Plinian gens. Under the strict
l, 'usages of the republic he would have become C. Plinius C. F. ’
Secundus Caecilianus, but. under the empire testamentary
· adoption was little more than the bequeathing of property '
· under condition of a change of name, and accordingly we find
that his official title was C. Plinius L. F. Caecilius Secundus⁷
Pliny was now eighteen years of age, and we find him within
a year making his datur as a pleader before the centumviral
court in the Basilica lulia⁸ This court continued to be his
special arena,9 and though in later life he practised there less
frequently, he had not entirely given it up when the last book
of his Letters was published. It was soon after this, but pro-

· bably not until Domitian was emperorst⁰ that Pliny married his

first wife,11 while about the same time he achieved his first
signal success in the centumviral court¹² In 81 or 82 AJ).
