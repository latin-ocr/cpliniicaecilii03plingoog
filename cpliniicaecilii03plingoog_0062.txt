the accusation. These Pliny, and his colleague Albinus, decided
to take separately, on the principle of the horse's tail. The
case against Classicus himself was easily proved, since his own
handwriting showed that he had made four million sesterces out

of the province. It was decided ‘bonaClassici quae habuisset ante
provinciam a reliquis¹ separari, illa filiae, haec spoliatis relinqui'
With regard to his subordinateS, the accusers had first to prove
‘ut constaret ministerium crimen esse,' the plea oi the accused
being that as provincials they were bound to obey the pro-
consul. However, the point was made good, and two of them
were ‘in quinquennium relegati' A iew days later Cluvius
Fuscus, son-inrlaw of Classicus and Priscus, the tribune of a
cohort, were tried ; the former, probably owing to private in·
fiuence, was acquitted‚ the latter banished sor two years, In
the third trial a number of minor offenders were tried together,
os whom some were acquitted‚ some condemned, ‘relegatis aliis
in tempuS, aliis in perpetuum? In the latter part os the trial
an incident occurred which showed the ‘animus' of the
senatorial iudices and the danger to which the provincial
legates were sometimes exposed. While Casta, the wife of
Classicus was being tried, one oi the witnesseS, probably
subomed by the defendants accused Norbanus one of the
legates of praevaricatio with Casta. Legally this question
should have been postponed till the original trial was decided,
but personal feelings against Norbanus overruled constitutional
rules, and he was tried then and there, not only on the charge
of praevaricatio but os other matters perfectly unconnected with
the present trial. No formal copies os the accusations were
shown him, and he was ‘in insulam relegatus? Casta, how-
ever, in spite os the presumed praevaricatio of her accuser, was
somewhat inconsistently acquitted.

The next two cases were both connected with Bithynia,
and in both Pliny defended the accused. Iulius Bassus who sor
some reason had been ‘relegated’ by Domitian, was proconsul
’ of Bithynia under Nerva, and on his return was accused by the
province, which as usual sent legati to conduct its case, and
among them one Theophanes ‘fax accusationis et origo¹ · The
trial took place in 103 or 104 A.D. What the other offences
oi Bassus may have been we have no means of knowing from
the' ex parte statement of Pliny (iii 9), but by his own confes·
