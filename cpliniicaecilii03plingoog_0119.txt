C. PLINI ET TRAIANI

alioqui quietissimum hortatur et natalium splendor et summa
integritas in paupertate et ante omnia felicitas temporum, quae

sulibusgedidisset3 posse et alios profiteri
sr gratiae aut meritis confiderent.’ But

also Vell. Patere. ii 124, ‘Quo tempore
mihi¹ patrique meo candidatis Caesaris,

asamatteroffacttheemperor’snominees proxime a nobilissimis ac sacerdotibus
would always stand the best chance of viris destinari praetoribus contigit, con·

¹ election, and if he chose to nominate

exactly the number of vacancies, the
electiori was practically decided by his
nominatior. Tac Ann. i 14, ‘Candi-
datos praeturae duodecim nominavit,
numerum ab Augusto traditum: et hor-
tante senatu ut augeret, iureiurando ob-
strinxit, se non excessurum) Also in
ii 36, Asinius Gallus proposes that the
emperor ‘duodecim candidatos in singulos
annosnominaret.’ There was sometimes,
however, a real contest in the senate,
Tac. Ann. ii 51 ; and Suet. Vesp. 2,
and the number of the emperor’s nomin-
ees, no doubt, varied from time to time.
Cf. also Dio Cass 58, 20.

(2) By a development from the old
Republican custom of commendatio, the
emperors had the right of recommending
a certain number of candidates (candidati
Caesaris), who were, as a matter of course,
elected without any opposition‚ Tac
Ann. i 25, ‘moderante Tiberio ne plures
quam quatuor candidatos commendaret,
sine repulsa et ambitu designandos’
This passage (referring to the praetorship)
proves that out of twelve appointments
only four were absolutely at the disposal
of the emperor, who did not, however,
himselfappoint, but merely recommended
to the senate. lt is noticeable that no
instance is known of the emperor’s com-
mendatio for the consulship, until the
end of Neto’s reign, Tac. Hist. i 77,
‘ceteri consulatusex destinatione Neronis
aut Galbae mansere,’ and Hist. ii. 71,
after which the consulship was absolutely
at the disposal of the emperor, to a much
greater extent than any of the subordinate
maglstracles. With regard to these latter
the right of commendatio remained un·
altered. It is mentioned but indefinitely
in the ‘lex regia de imperi0‚' previous to
Vespasian's reign, ‘uti quos magistratum
potestatem imperium curationemve cuius
rer petentes senatui populoque Romano
commendaverit quibusque suffragationem
suam dederit promiserit, eorum comitiis
quibusque extra ordinem ratio habeatur.’
Those who were thus commended usually
received the honorary title of praetor or
quaestor candidatus. Thus Orelli, 133,
2759, 3151, also I.N. 5983, ‘per omnes
honores candidatus Augustorum’ See

secutis, ut neque post nos quemquam
Divus Augustus neque ante nos Caesar
commendaret Tiberius' Pliny, Panegyr.
69, describes, as Mommsen shows, the
praetorian comitia, Staatsreclrt, vol. ii

. 879. In this case Trajan introduces
lis candidati in person, being himself
consul, ‘alii cum laetitia' (ie. the eom-
mendati) ‘alii cum spe' (aa the nominati)
‘recesserunt’ ·

The number of praetors varied at dif-
ferent times. Under Augustus it was
usually 12, Dio Cass. 56, 25, ’ἀλλ’
ol δώδεκα ἐπὶ πολι) κατέστησαν,’ but some·
times sixteen.

Under Tiberius some extraordinary
praetorships were conferred upon dela·
tores. Tac. Ann. ii32, ‘praeturae extra
ordinem datae iis qui senatorii ordinis
erant'; and, accordingly, Dio Cass.
58, 20, ’πεντεκαίδεκα στρατηγοὶ ἐγένοντο·
καὶ τοῦτο ἐπὶ πολλὰ ἔτη συνέβη.’ So,
too, under Caligula, Dio Cass. 59, 20.
Under Claudius it varied from fourteen to
eighteen, Dio Cass. 60, 10, ‘dianthus

δὲ δὴ ol στρατηγοὶ ἀπεδείκνυντο· καὶ γὰρ .

τεσσαρακαίδεκα καὶ immanifesta, διὰ μέσον
τε. . .ἐγένοντο.’ Under Nero there was
a fixed number, probably seventeen, Tac.
Anu. xiv 28; while Nerva added one

to preside over cases of dispute between ³

individuals and the fiscus, Dig. 1, 2, 2, 323
Panegyr. 36. The judicial functions of the
praetorswerediminished(1),bythejudicial
power of the princeps 3 (2)- of the senate ;
(3) of the praefectus urbi. But the
praetor urbanus and praetor peregrinus
still retained their judicial functions‚ Tac.

Ann. i 15, ‘mox celebratio ad praetorem '

translata cui inter cives et peregrinos
iurisdictio evenisset23 others presided
over the various iudicia, Tac. Anu. i 75,
‘nec patrum cognitionibussatiatusiudiciis
adsidebat in comu tribunalis, ne prae·
torem curuli depelleret,' and Suet. Tifer.
333 one at least presided over cases of
fidei commissa, Suet. Claud. 23, and
Orelli, 3135, ‘praetori de fidei commissis'
arrd one after Nerva over cases connected
with the fiscus. But by the time of Nero
