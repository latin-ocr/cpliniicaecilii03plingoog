emperor on the first day of theirappointment.1 . This address
was made by Pliny the occasion of an elaborate panegyric, iu
which the various measures of th'e first three years of Trajan’s
reign are described and eulogised, not without frequent refer·
'ences by way of contrast to the· regim of Domitian. This
oration was afterwards still further elaborated by its author,
and after being recited to his friends during no less than three
days,2 was published‚ and it is the only example of Pliny’s
speeches which we nowpossess. It is by no means without
historical value, though it does not gIve us avery favourable ι’
view of Pliny as' an orator. Somewhere about this time Pliny
married his third wife, Calpurnia,3 the grand-daughter of
Calpurnius Fabatus, who was a fellow-townsman os Pliny,⁴ and
a man of some influence and wealth at Comum⁵ Pliny's desire
for children⁶ was destined to be again disappointed, but he
obtained as a special favour from Trajan the ‘ius trium liber-
orum.’⁷ A three years' tenure of the praefecture of the
treasury would have ended at the close of 100 A.D., but, per-
haps owing to his efficient discharge of its duties, Pliny was
continued in it at least for another year. In August of 101
we find him begging for leave of absence to run down to 'his
estate at Tifernum, and it was while he was absent there that
the envoys from the province of Baetica begged him to under-
take their causeagainst Classicus.8 As in the case of Marius,
Pliny was again reluctant, but he was again induced to under-
take the case, partly from the consideration that as Classicus
was dead, his action involved no danger to a senator, and als0,
as this was the third occasion on which he had prosecuted a
provincial governor, he would find it more easy to refuse such
requests for the future. The trial was a long and somewhat
intricate one, and though Classicus himself had escaped con·
demnation by death, several of his subordinates and accomplices
were brought to justice⁹ -It was not long after this, probably
