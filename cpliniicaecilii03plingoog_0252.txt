EPISTULARUM CXVIII! 235

Rogo ergo ut dubitationem meam regere, id est, beneficia tua
interpretari ipse digneris

dandaque quae tuno, etc. This is beneficia tua, that is, the privileges

iselasticum tunc primum mihi videtur incipere deberi, cum

The privileges you speak oi · ought, in
my opinion, only to begin atter the ῑῑί·Ι
umphal entry has taken place, nor are
the prizes for the contests which I have
made iselastic due to any victors prior t0
that date. 'The fact that the victors uo
longer receive the peusion ior the con-
tests from which Ι have taken away the
iselastic 'privileges since their victories,
does not assist their claim, ior though the
conditions os the contests are changed,

the payments madptyaffi are not re·
claimed.

iselastioum=t emoney or sood given
. to the victors. cf. ‘iselastici nomina'

incipere. This word, like the ‘ex eo
die’ oi the previous letter, implies a
continuous or periodical payment.

the question, ‘haereo ne cuiusquam retro

neo proficere pro desiderio, etc.
The passage is handed down in a corrupt
form. Avantius has ‘potest quid eorum
quae postea iselastica non lege constitui
quam qui ierant accipere desierunt,' which
Ddring fancies can be· made satisfactory
bya simple change of non into ‘nova’
He, however, has to take i 1) ‘quid eorum
quae postea constitui’ any of my subse-
quent regulations, as subject oi ‘potest ;’
(2) he apparently takes iselastica as abl.
agreeing with ‘nova lege ;’ (3) he refers
‘quam to a ‘nec magis,’ which, as he
uaively observes, Pliny had better have

put in; and (4) he takes ‘qui ierant’ as
those who have made their triumphal
entry. ii all these iour points were as
admissible as they are the opposite, lstill
fail to see how the sentence could be trans·
lated. Catanaeus. with no better success,
reads ‘potesta tam eorum: quae postea
iselastica lege constitui: quam curn vincer-
ent esse desierunt) ‘Lege'must evidently
be wrong ;· and ‘qui ierant’ is unmean-
ing. Schaeffer's change oi ‘non lege’
into ‘non esse‚' and ‘quamqui ierant'
into ‘quam vicerunt,’ renders the pass· ¹
age periectly intelligible, and is, I have
no doubt, right. ‘Nor does it help their
case that they have ceased to receive the
stipeud for those contests which since
their victories 1 have determined are
not to be iselastic. For,’ etc. Thu, oi
course, refers to Pliny's words, ‘sicut
nou dentur sibi pro his certaminibus quae
esse iselastica postquam vicerunt des·
ierunt.

nihilo minus quae ante perasper-
ατη, etc. The argument oi the athletes
is that it is uot consistent ior them to
lose the future emoluments os contests
since made non-iselastic, and not to gain
those oi contests made iselastic since'
their victory. lies—Trajan answers—
it is periectly consistent, neither action is
retrospective: in the one case their retro-
spective claims are not allowed; in the
other the emoluments already received
are not taken away. Trajan must have
been a little ironical iu this latter state·
ment, aad one cannot but feel that the
athletes have some cause to complain oi v
the imperial logie. Avantius reads ‘quae
