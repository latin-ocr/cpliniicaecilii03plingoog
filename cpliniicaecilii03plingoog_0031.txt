conquesta, however, had been too rapid to be secure, and
Trajan, carried away by the flush os victory, instead of se-
curing what he had won, was led away by vague dreams ol
rivalling Alexander, and sailed down with his fleet to the
mouth of the Tigris ;1 and while courier aiter courier was
announcing to the astonished senate successes over tribes till
then unheard oi,² the news reached Trajan, who was wintering at
Babylon, that in Armenia, Eastern Mesopotamia, and Osrhoene
there had been simultaneous risings, while sarther away in
Cyrene and Cyprus srightsul atrocities were being perpetrated
by the insurgent Jews. ln Mesopotamia-the rising, though

= not without obstinate resistance‚ was stamped down by

Lusius Quietus, but Armenia was only won back by offering

cognomen ‘optimus’ No actos cruelty is attributed to him,
and the title of ‘pater patriae' was in his case no unmeaning or
unfitting term. His reign marks a change os spirit rather
than of institutions; a benevolent despotism was substituted
for a tyranny, but the radical defects of a centralised govern-
ment in a heterogeneous empire were concealed, not removed.
In his frontier wars the Augustan policy was for the first time
essentially modified, perhaps not before it was time, but the
