:32 INTRODUCTION

The patroni were appointed by the praetor, but provincials
might now conduct their own case. Reimbursement was made
double, and probably exile inflicted in more serious cases (Cic.
de Or. ii 147). By the lex Cornelia of Sulla, exile was cer-
tainly established as a punishment (Cic. Verr. ii 31); quad-
ruple reimbursement was introduced, and probably a mild
sorm os infamia. The question unfortunately came to be
mixed up with the party struggle between the optimates and
populares, and equestrian iudices were substituted sor senatorial,
and senatorial for equestrian, with very little advantage to the
provincials. But still a certain advance was made, though
much yet remained to be improved. The provincial governors
were still masters through the iudicia of the property ol the
provincials. They could exact illegal taxes, and enforce ,con-
tributions in the form os money, corn, or ships, while their
opportunities of private plunder were innumerable. The
Sicilians put their claim to reimbursement against Verres at
sorty million sesterces. That the laws were not wholly dead
letters is shown by such trials under the lex Calpurnia as those

A distinctly fresh step and a very important one, though
the republican government can hardly be credited with it, was
the lex Iulia os 59 B.C., which, the Digest says :-‘ ad eas
pecunias pertinet quas quis in magistratu, potestate, legatione,

’ vel quo alio officio, munere, ministerio ve publico cepit vel

cum ex cohorte eius eorum est.' By this law all oppression ol
provincials in its widest extent was made a punishable offense,
illegal taxes (Cic. in Pis. 37), arbitrary tolls, excessive demands
sor the support of soldiers or staff-officers were forbidden3 all
presents except within strictly defined limits were prohibited,
and an end was put to the selling of privileges and immunities
either to individuals or states (Cic. in Pis. 3 5), while the gover-
nor's accounts had to be audited after the expiration os his

term (Cic. ad Aa. vi 7). Pecuniary reimbursement was still
