basilicae choo. Basilicae, the name was the interior of the semicircular part

of which was derived from the στοὰ of the theatre, the rows of seats (cunei)

βασιλική at Athens, were quadrangular rising out behind one another from the

buildings flanked by colonnades, with orchestra at the bottom to the external

two, three, or five aisies. They were wall of the theatre at the top. The

used for commercial purposes‚ or more
commonly for judicial courts, Plin. Ep.
vi 23, as agathe Basilica Iulia for that
of the centumviri. There were no
basilicae in Rome before 21413.c., Livy,
xxvi 27. In 184 tac. the Basilica Portia
was built, which was followed by many
others; cf. Suet. Aug. 29, etc. Some·
times, however, the name was applied to
buildings constructed on this plan, which
had no business object at all, but were
attached to a theatre, or library, or gym-
nasium. These were more strictly called
‘porticus' a name properly applied to
the covered colonnade flanking the nave
of the basilica, but they are sometimes
called basilicae or regiae. Thus the
‘porticus Pompeil' at the back of the
scena of the theatre of Pompeius is also
called by Suetonius a ‘regia’; Suet.

exterior wall was divided into stories by ¹
arcades of pillars or pilasters, like the
Colosseum or the theatre of Marcellus at
Rome. Between these exterior arcades
and the seats of the cavea were corridors
with staircases leading to the several
praecinctiones. At the top there was
often a double row of columns extending
all round the cavea, and forming a kind
of ambulatory, round which the audience
could walk. This is the porticus alluded
to in this passage, more nearly resembling
the porticus often attached to a private
house than the more extensive colonnades
like the porticus Pompeii, or Octaviae,
or Caii et Lucii, Suet. Aug. 293 cf.
