EPISTULARUM LXXV

186

reliquum omne Heracleotarum et Tianorum civitatibus redde·
rem, ita ut esset arbitrii mei utrum opera facienda quae honori
tuo consecrarentur putarem an instituendos quinquennales

antur: ideo autem cretio appellata est,
quia cernere est quasi decernere et con-
stituere' The usual formula in wills was
‘Heres Titius esto: cernitoque in cen·
tum diebus proxumis’3 ἓ 166, ‘et qui
ita heres institutus est, si velit heres esse,
debebit intra diem cretionis cernere, id
est haec verba dicere'; ‘Quod me (Iulius
Largus) testamento suo heredem instituit,
eam hereditatem adeo cernoque.’ Cf.
Cic. ad Art. xi 2, ‘eo ipso die ex testa-
mento crevi hereditatem'3 and xiii 46,

’ ‘Tum ex eo cognovi cretionem Cluvii,

liberam cretionem, testibus praesentibus,
sexaginta diebus' ; Liv. xxiv 25. For
‘adire hereditatem,’ cf. Cic. Phil. ii 16,
‘cum ipse hereditatem patris non adisses’;

Ἴ 8661. Aug. 8.

praeceptis quinquaginta milibus
nummum. ‘Praeceptis’is no doubt the
right reading, not ‘perceptis' as Avan-
tius reads. Cf. Plin. Ep. v 7, 1, ‘Satur-
ninus autem‚ qui nos reliquit heredes,
quadrantem reipublicae nostrae, deinde
pro quadrante praeceptionem quadrin-
gentorum milium dedit.' Dtg.3o‚125‚
‘si heres centum praecipere iussus sit,’
etc.; and 36, 1, 63, ‘sed cum praecepta
aliqua re aut summa rogatus sit heres
restituere,’etc. Gierig's quotation of Suet.
Aug. 101 in favour os perceptis is not to
the point, ‘quamvis viginti proximis
annis quaterdecies millies ex testamentis
amicorum percepisset‚’ where percep. is
not a techmcal term at all. So in Suet.
Tib. 15, ‘ne hereditatem quidem aut
legata percepit ulla‚¹ etc. Praecipere
can be used only of the heres ; percipere
, either of the heres or the legatarius.

reliquum omne E et Τ. civitatibus
redderem. Civitates as ‘personae in·
certae’ could neither receive inheritances
or legacies (Ulp. Frag. xxii 5), because
there was no one to go through the
solemn form of cretio. cf. Plin. Ep. v
7, 1, ‘nec heredem institui nec percipere
posse rempublicam constat‚' aud so the
will of Saturninus, which left a praecep·

’ tionem quadringentorum milium to the

city of Comum, was, as Pliny says, ‘si
ius adspicias, irritum, si defuncti volun-
tatem, ratum et firmum est.' But by the
senatus consultum Afraniauum, passed
under Trajan, they might receive pro·
perty by means of fidei-commissum.
Dz'g. 36, 1, 26, ‘Omnibus civitatibus
quae sub imperio populi Romani sunt,

restitui debere et posse hereditatem fidei-
commissam Afranianum senatus consul·
tum iubet’ The hereditas in question
there was 66 ‘hereditas fidei commis·
saria': hence the expression ‘rogavit
testamento’ Cf. Gaius, ii 249, ‘Verba
autem fidei commissorum haec in usu
esse videntur: peto: rogo. volo. fidei
committo’ By the senatus consultum
Pegasianum, nn. 70, the heres was

allowed to retain one-fourth part of the .

estate against the fidei-commissarius3 just
as by the lex Falcidia he would retain
one-fourth against the legatarii. Gaius,
ii 254, ‘sed rursus quia heredes scripti,
cum aut totam hereditatem aut paene
totam plerumque restituere rogabantur,
adire hereditatem ob nullum aut mini·
mum lucrum recusabant, atque ob id
extinguebantur fidei commissa, postea
Pegaso et Pusione consulibus senatus

censuit ut 61 qui rogatus esset hereditatem ’

restituere perinde liceret quartam partem
retinere atque e lege Falcidia in legatis
retinere conceditur.’ His position had
already 6666 improved by the senatus
consultum Trebellianum, passed under
Nero, by which all actiones in connec-
tion with the estate were to be against
the fidei commissarius, and not against
the heir. Gaius, ii 253. If the heir were
asked to deduct, not a fourth of the
estate, 661 some particular sum or thing,
equal to not less than oue-fourth, as in
the present case, he had a certain further
advantage in that he received this sum
free from all encumbrances, as ii he had
acquired it under a legacy ; whereas by
receiving generally one-fourth he was
subject to that proportion of the actiones
against the estate. Just. ii 23, 9, ‘siquis
una aliqua re deducta sive praecepta . . .
rogatus sit restituere hereditatem,’ etc.
See Hunter’s Roman Law, pp. 630-641.

Heracleotarum Heraclea Pontica
and its territory formed one of the eleven
regions into which Pompeius divided
Pontus, Strab. xii 541. 11 was founded
about 556 ac. by Megarians and Tana-
graeans (Ptol. v 26, 6), 16 166 territory
os the Maryandini. Pliny, h. n. vi 1,
says 11 was ‘oppidum Lyco flumini
oppositum’ It was at one time a flour-
ishing seaport, and one of the chief seats
of the lucrative tunny fishery. Since the
Mithridatic wars, however, it had de·
clined.
