temples, the vestiges of which form a striking contrast to the
desolation of the region at the present time.

After his return from the Dacian wars TraJan remained at Rome
¹ engaged with the general cares of the empire for the next six years.
Anything like a detailed history of the period is impossible 'Dio
Cassius passes it over almost in silence, the allusions of Pliny are often
obscure, and our chief source of information consists in medals and
inscriptions. To this period we must assign the various steps which
Trajan took to restore to Italy something of its former prosperity.1 Of
these the first place in importance is held by the system of ‘allmenta
tiones,' commenced indeed by Νεπνει,2 but worked out by Trajan.³
A sum of money assigned from the ‘fiscus’ was lent to a number of
landowners in a particular district, or to the community itself, the
security being a mortgage on the estate, which was however never
, allowed to exceed about one-tenth of its total value. The interest to be
paid for this loan varied according to local circumstances from two and
ahalf to five per cent, although the general rate of interest was as much
as ten per cent, and was paid by the mortgagees as a monthly support
for a number of poor boys and girls of the district. How far this
custom extended throughout Italy we do not know, but the words of
Dion and the medals seem to imply that it was a general one, and we
may therefore take the two inscriptions which give us most of our
information⁴ as particular examples of a general system. At Veleia a
sum of 1,044,0oo HS. was assigned on mortgage to 46 estates, the
collective value of which was 1 3,077, 5 36 HS. The interest at five pert
cent (52,200 HS.) was employed in 245 grants of 16 HS.a month
for boys, in 34 grants of 12 HS. a month for girls, while 12 and 10
HS. a month were set apart respectively for one illegitimate boy and
girl The object of the institution was a double one. While it helped
poor parents to bring up their children, and so provided citizens and
soldiers, it also assisted Italian husbandry by providing capital at low
rates of interest. Another though more questionable means towards
this end was the provision that provincial candidates for office at Rome
should invest one-third of their property in Italian land⁵ A third
institution intended to improve the condition of Italy was that of
appointing ‘curatores civitatum,' extraordinary magistrates nominated
by they emperor to regulate the often disorganised finances of the
Italian cities. In certain cases interference of this sort may have been
an advantage, especially as Italy was not under the eye of a provincial
