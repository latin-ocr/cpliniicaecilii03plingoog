and Christians was sure before long to reveal the latter to the ’
Roman government as an independent body involving possibly
greater political dangers than the sullen and obstinate fanaticism
of the conquered Jews. That this danger would be increased
by Jewish spite and malevolence was extremely probable, while
the toleration hitherto enjoyed by the Christians must for the
future, is granted at all, be granted independently of any supposed
connection with the Jews, since Jewish toleration‚ instead of being
a fixed maxim of Roman policy, was now precarious only and
conditional upon the behaviour of the Jews themselves, Under
Q these dangers were not yet realised. Familiar with
oriental superstitions, and inclined as all the Romans were to an
indoleut laissez-faire in religious matters especially in the case
of a newly·conquered enemy, he contented himself with exacting
from the Jews the Temple tribute of two drachmae, while the
Christians were still so iar identified with the Jews that they -
apparently paid, and were possibly as amatter of policy content
to pay, this tribute too. This at least seems on the whole to
be the best way of interpreting the language in Suetonius
(Dum. 12), ‘ praeter ceteros iudaicus fiscus acerbissime actus est :
ἱ ad quem deferebantur qui vel improfessi Iudaicam viverent vitam

(ie. Christianmyl dissimulata origine imposita genti tributa non
T

pependissent.’ his state of things seems to have continued till
the last year of Domitian's reign, when, according to Lactantius,
Eusebius Melitffld'o‘ther‘ecclesiastical writerS, such as Zonaras,
of a later date, there was a persecution of the Christians in Rome.
Ἴ Os this persecution, however, contemporary writers are completely
silent, and even the Christian authors themselves know nothing
‘of any details of the persecution and confine themselves to vague
and general statements In Dio Cassius alone, wh0, however,
wrote more than a hundred years after the event, there is a
passage which may possibly throw some light on what really
. took place. He says (67,14)‘Kp'v τῷ αὐτῷ ἔτει ἄλλους τε
πολλοὺς καὶ τὸν Φλάβιον Κλήμεντα ὑπατεύοντα, καίτερ ἀνέψιον,
ὄντα καὶ γυναῖκα καὶ αὐτὴν συγγενῆ ‘aratori Φλάβιον Δομιτΐλλαν
ἔχοντα κατέσφαξεν ὁ Δομιτιανός· ἐτηνέχθη δὲ ἀμφοῖν ἔγκλημα
ἀθεότητος ὑφ’ ἧς καὶ ἄλλοι ἐς τὰ τῶν 'lophaim ἤθη ἐξοκέλλοντες ¹
πολλοὶ κατεδικάσθησαν.’ And rth*er⁸ on he mentions that
Acilius Glabrio was accused ont esame charge, and also sor
fighting with wild beasts.
