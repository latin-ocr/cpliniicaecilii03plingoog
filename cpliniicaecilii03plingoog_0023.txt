games ;l his palace was open to all,2 while the general spirit of
his rule appears in the anecdote given by Dio, that on girding
the praefect of the praetorians with the sword of office, he told
him to use it for him if he ruled well, against him if he ruled ill.³

For Trajan's administrative and legislative activity in Rome before
the Dacian wars we owe all our information to Pliny's Panegyric, an
address of thanks to the emperor, which as one of the ‘consules suffecti’
he delivered in the senate in September 100 ao. One of the first
acts was the punishment of the ‘delatores' from whom so much mischief ·
had arisen under Domitian After being subJected to public ignominy,
apparently in the amphitheatre, they were sent away to various places
of exile.4 In close connection with this act of justice was the resolu-
tion no longer to employ the ‘leges maiestatis '⁵ as a means either of
getting money or intimidating the nobles. On the contrary, the sena·
torial families were encouraged to corne forward into public life, and
special concessions were made to their younger members whereby the

offices might be filled at an earlier age⁶ Another matter of general
and even vital interest was the corn supply. By establishing free trade
in corn between the various parts of the empne, the liability to famine
was reduced to a minimum 3 and Egypt, on which the city had been
wont to depend for its corn, was actually relieved in a bad season b'y
the capital.⁷ The list of recipients of corn in the city also was sub

jected to a revision, and was made to include 5000 poor children, a
step due partly, no doubt, to charity, but even more to the necessity of
supplying increased numbers of future citizens and soldiers⁸ devoted to
his service. In financial matters Trajan was generous‚ perhaps even
as Pliny suspected,⁹ to imprudence. By establishing a special court
appointed by lot for fiscal matters‚1⁰ an appearance at any rate of im-
partiality was given to cases in which the emperor had a direct interest.
Further, the ‘aureum coronarium' presented to the emperor on his
accession by the provinces was remitted‚11 and concessions were made
in connection with the ‘vicesima hereditatum' in the case of fathers
inheriting from sons and brothers from sisterS, although the parties did
not possess the ‘ius cognationis.’12 Other ‘vectigalia' too were remitted.¹⁸.
On the other hand, the prosperity caused by the mild and equitable
· administration rendered indirect taxation far more profitable to the
government21egacies to the emperor, no longer compelled by fear,
were dictated to a much greater extent by love, and holders of irregular
successions, for which ‘delatores ’ had hitherto been on the watch, were
now induced by the promise of one-half of the estate to declare the
irregularity and pay the other half into the ‘aerarium’ If we add to this
