the legions in the senatorial provinces, the proconsul would
only act on a direct mandate from the emperor.
As holders of supreme, zie. undelegated authority, the pro-

consuls were privileged to appoint legati as deputieS, manda-
torieS, or delegates of their power. Of these, consular proconsuls
could appoint three, the others only one each. These assisted
the proconsul in his various dutieS, and in case of his absence
or death represented him in the province. To mark their
delegated power and their subordination to the proconsul, these
,officers were pro praetore, and as they were appointed by the
proconsul they were in full ‘legati proconsulis pro praetore’
Besides these legati, who were responsible at first to the pro-
consul only, but whose responsibility to the senate as well was
established at a later time (Plin. Ep. iv 9 and vi 29), the pro-
consul had under him a quaestor appointed by the senate to
manage all the financial relations between the province and the
aerarium, which were thus taken out of the governor's hand,
while his own personal staff or ‘cohors' consisting of personal
friends or proteges, were employed in various more undefined
dutieS, but all responsible finally to the senate. Financial
matters being not within the proconsul's functionS, and military
power being rarely allowed him, his duties were mainly admini-
strative and judicial. The former were perhaps by their nature
vague both in their extent and in their limitationS, the latter
necessarily depended much on the circumstances of the pro·
vince. In theory all the civitates liberae and foederatae were
extra provinciam, in the province but not of it, privileged to
use their own laws and constitutions ; practically, as Mommsen
points out in the case of .Greece, all these high-sounding titles
and privileges were entirely precarious and might be annulled
by a stroke of ,the proconsul's pen. ln judicial matters civil
jurisdiction was perhaps the most prominent of the proconsul’s

duties The province was divided into conventus and in pass· .

ing from one to another of these the proconsul and his legates
spent most ofn their year of office (ng. i 16, 5). From the
legates there was an appeal to the proconsul, but from the
latter, except for Roman citizens there was no further appeal,
and his decisions were final. In criminal matters ordinary
cases were tried before the municipal magistrates but important
cases came before the proconsul, who, except in the case of
