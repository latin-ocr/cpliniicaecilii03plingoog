12 INTRODUCTION

between Pliny and the emperor, though highly instructive, can-
not be taken as an example of Trajan's general habit, though .,
we may be sure that the care, solicitude, and fairness displayed
in his replies were characteristic of his administration through· ·
out the empire. The points which come out most clearly in the
correspondence are, besides the careful attention paid to details
which was probably exceptional, the consistent desire shown
by Trajan to respect local customs and usages,1 the avoidance
of general rules and principles,2 and the equitable spirit³ which
insists on the execution of the laws, but observes vested
interestS,4 and avoids the appearance of anything arbitrary.
Perhaps the most important answer of Trajan is that concern-
ing the proceedings against the Christiana “They should not
be sought out, but if brought before you, and convicted, they
must be punished. If the accused denies his religion, and
proves his denial by supplication to our gods, in spite of
previous suspicion, he should be pardoned.’' This reply made
Christianity a definite political offence, and laid down the
precedent which in fact characterised the subsequent persecu-
tions. If Bithynia demanded a special share of Trajan’s
attention, the other non-military provinces were not neglected.
Marius Priscus was convicted of mal-administration in Africa,⁵
Classicus was called to account for his conduct in Baetica‚⁶
while Marius Maximus was sent on a special mission to ,
¹ regulate the affairs of Achaia.⁷ The establishment of ‘praefecti
vehiculorum,’8 to prevent abuses and extortion in connection
with the public post-system must have been a common boon
to all the provinces. ·

The last years of Trajan's reign were occupied by a Parthian
war. Possibly the interval of peace had become irksome to
his warlike temperament, possibly he deemed it necessary to

’ pursue the same forward policy on the¹ eastern frontier which

had apparently met with success on the Danube. ln any case,
the affairs of Armenia, as usual, offered the pretext for war.
The Parthian king Chosroes had set up his brother Partha-
masiris on the throne, and though he sought investitura from
Trajan, the emperor finally put aside the policy which Nero's
