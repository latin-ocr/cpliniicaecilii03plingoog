’ the craze‚ not unfashionable among Roman ladies, for Jewish' proselyt-
ism, but that she herself understood the distinction between Judaism
.. 'a‘n‘d Christianity‚ or could have made Nero understand it t00, or that
through her influence ‘the Jews were in the ascendant at the' imperial
court at that moment,' are none of them suppositions which have suffi-
cient probability to be taken into serious account. That with or with-
out Poppaea's help, ‘the Jews may have taken the opportunity of
calumniating the Christians‚ and so transferring much of the sudden
odium from themselves to this hated sect‚’ is what I have already said,
but that by no means shows a Christian persecution to have taken
place. But Dr. Lightfoot lays even more stress on the language of
Tacitus and Suetonius, who both of them distinctly mention the

Ι, Christians as the victims of Nero's cruelty. The view that they may
be ‘injecting into the incidents of the reign of Nero the language and
experience that belong to the age of Trajan,’ he regards as a wholly
gratuitous assumption. That it is an assumption which cannot be
proved is not denied, but at least it has the advantage of explaining the
facts, which Dr. Lightfoot's assumption about the all-predominant
influence of Poppaea and her use of it against the Christians does not
do. Nor can it be said to be gratuitous. These notices, written
certainly not before the second decade of the 'second century, are the
very first indications in non-Christian writers that the Christians were ⁴
ζ J regarded as an independent body, or were in fact known by name to
the Roman world at all. Josephus, Seneca, and the elder Pliny are
absolutely silent about them. This silence does not prove that those
writers knew nothing about the Christians‚ but it certainly gives some
grounds for the assumption, while both Tacitus and Suetonius, whose
notices about the Christians are later in date than Pliny's letter, might
have gained their information, if in no other way, from their mutual
friend. But Dr. Lightfoot finds positive arguments for his own view in
the account of Tacitus and Suetonius. In the first place, Tacitus says,
‘quos vulgus Christianos apellabat,’ not the ‘common people calls,' but
‘the common people called them Christians‚' tle. in Nero's time. It
seems obvious to remark on this, that if Tacitus was, as assumed,
speaking of Nero's time with the knowledge only gained in his own, he
would naturally have made his account consistent by the use of the
fitting tenses. Again: ‘Tacitus himself betrays no signs of confusing
the two. His knowledge of the origin of Christianity is decidedly
more accurate than his knowledge of the origin of Judaism,’ and, ‘It is
an important fact that both these writers regard Christianity as a new
religion’ Surely Dr. Lightfoot misunderstands the point of the argu-
ment It is not contended by any one that either Tacitus or Suetonius
confused the Christians with the Jews, or that they regarded Christianity
as other than a new religion. On the contrary, the assumption with
which Dr. Lightfoot finds fault, is that, knowing, from whatever source,
the distinction themselves, they wrongly described the events of Nero's
