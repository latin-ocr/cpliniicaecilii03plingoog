242 APPENDIX ἵ

Dr. Lightfoot makes with regard to the probability of a mistake on the

part of the epitomator. The epitomator was xiphilinus, a monk of the
eleventh century, and the very fact that he does not distinctly claim
Clemens and Domitilla as Christian martyrs, seems to show that he
simply reproduced the statement of Dio as he found it At any rate,
ifhe departed from his authority at all, we should have expected him
rather to bring out than to slur over the distinction between the two
classes, if that distinction was traceable in Dio. But though Ι do not
think that Dr. Lightfoot has weakened the case of those who do not
believe that the Jews and Christians were clearly distinguished up to
the reign of Domitian, and who therefore refuse to admit that the
persecutions of that emperor and Nero were levelled primarily against
the Christians as a body, I believe that he is quite right in calling
attention to an aspectos the matter which, as he says, has been strangely
overlooked. ‘The mere negative fact,' he says, ‘that the Christian

, religion had not been recognised as lawful would be an ample justifica-
) tion for proceedings against the Christians as soon as it came to be
recognised that Christianity was something distinct from Judaism. No

Ἴ positive prohibition was needed Here wasa religion rampant, which
ts had never been licensed by the state, and this fact alone was sufficient
to set the law in motion' With one or two qualifications, this may be
V. accepted as correct. The statement, however, that every religion in
order to be free from persecution needed to be licensed, is too sweeping.

The general principle of the Roman government in matters of religion

, was toleration, and only those religions which by in anyway taking the
' form of collegia constituted a political danger, or were dangerous to
public morality, would be liable to interference. The law therefore

which Dr. Lightfoot speaks of as able to be set in motion was no general

law against unlicensed religions, but rather the law general or special
against unlicensed collegia. Thus the worship of Isis was put down

,ι '¹ae more than once (Val Man i 3, 4: cf. also Tertull. Apol. 6), but
then we find evidence from inscriptions that there were numerous
‘collegia Isidis,’ which, joined to the secrecy of the worship, might easily

¹ be. made causes of political danger. Again Augustus granted toleration

ε’ , . to the Jewish worship, but he did this by instructing the governors of the
‘² Oriental provinces not to enforce against the Jews the strict laws
concerning associations and meetings (Mommsen, Rom. Gesclu'clrte, vol.

v, p. 497). Again Dio Cassius puts into the mouth of Maecenas the
maxims of Roman policy in this respect (52, 36) ε (τοὺς δὲ b) ξενίζοντάς τι

r περὶ αὐτὸ (τὸ θεῖον) καὶ μίσει καὶ κόλαζε μὴ μόνον τῶν θεῶν ἕνεκα ἀλλ’ ὅτι
καὶ καινά τινα δαιμόνια οἱ τοιοῦτοι ἀντεσφέροντες πολλοὺς ἀναπείθουσιν
ἀλλοτριονομεῖν κάκ τούτου καὶ συνωμοσίαι καὶ συστάσεις {tarpeios τε
γίγνονται] Lastly, as I have tried to show (p. 61), the persecution in
Bithynia was based on the edict which Pliny had issued against hetaeriae,

, ἕτεροι and not ἄλλοι. Tm former denotas difference of class or category‚ the latter
' difference between individuals in the same class.
