INTRODUCTION 3

so important a post from 89 till· 97, the date of his adoption
by Nerva, would have been contrary to all precedent. There is
no doubt that he was legate of the Legio I Adiutrix, then
stationed in Spain, and that he was sent to Germany to act

against Antonius Saturninus, who had induced the two legions ¹
at Vindonissa to revolt, and had even entered into communica·
tion with the Chatti.1 As a reward probably for the alacrity
shown upon this occasion, Trajan was made one of the ‘consules
¹ ordinarii' for 91 AD, a markos especial favour from anem·
.< peror whose own frequent consulships diminished the number
which he had to confer on others. Beyond this, however,
Domitian, who in his later years cherished an insane jealousy
for military talent, did not advance him. For the next six
years we know nothing os Trajan’s position, though from one
passage ol the Ραηεξγνιέ2 he seems to have lived at Rome and
shared the dangers of Domitian's reign of terr'or. But if he
was passed over by Domitian, promotion came with the election
of Nerva,3 by whom he was appointed legate ol Upper Germany,4
still perhaps, in spite ol the number os legions on the Danube,
the premier military command. There was, however, at this
period no need for military operations on the Rhine, and Trajan's
· work needed administrative ability even more than strategic skill.⁵
Domitian had inaugurated a new frontier policy in Upper
’ Germany. The Rhine was to be no longer the boundary.
With a sormidable tribe like the Chatti confronting the Roman
arms, it was deemed advisable to throw forward some farther
barrier in their way, and especially to command the valleys os
such tributary rivers as the Main and the Neckar, through which
at any time an enemy might penetrate. It was with this end that
Domitian had pushed forward his legions against the Chatti,
and commenced the ‘ limes’ extending from Friedberg through
worth to Lorch, where it was subsequently met by the Raetian
‘limes’ which ran eastward to Regensberg. By this means
the Black Forest, the region hitherto called the ‘Agri Decu-
