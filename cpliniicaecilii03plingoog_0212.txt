egerat vellet, tum Eumolpus adsistens Flavio Archippo dixit
exigendam esse a Dione rationem operis ante quam reipublicae
traderetur, quod aliter fecisset ac debuisset. Adiecit etiam 2
esse in eodem positam tuam statuam et corpora sepultorum,
uxoris Dionis et filii, postulavitque ut cognoscerem pro tribu-
nali. Quod cum ego me protinus facturum dilaturumque pro· 3

In the Digest, 18, 162, etc, the word is
used of property handed over by the
vendor to the purchaser.

opus cuius curam egerat. We
learn from Dio's speeches what this
was. Having succeeded in getting Prusa
made a conventus, he wished to make
it worthy of its position by splendid
public buildings. He therefore offered
generous donations himself and got his
friends also to subscribe towards build-
ing an extensive porticus or colonnade.
Or. xl., p. 487, ’λόγον τινὰ εἶτον ὑπὲρ
ἔργου τινος, οὐκ αὐτὸς μόνον άλλά καὶ τῶν
ἡγεμόνων ἐσπουδακότων . . . βουλομένων
· τὴν πόλιν άρεινον κατασκευάζειν καὶ σεμ-
νοτέραν ποιεῖν άπασαν.’ Of this work he
himself voluntarily took charge (curam
egit), ιἐπεὶ δὲ ἀρχτρ ἔλαβεν δσα μὲν αὐτὸς
ἔπαθον μετρῶν καὶ διαμετρῶν καὶ λογιζό·
μενος ὅπως μὴ ’γένοιτο ἀπρεπὲς μήδε
ἀχρεῖον , . . καὶ τελευταῖον εἰς τὰ ὄρη
φθειρόμενος, οὐκ ὢν ἔμπειρος τῶν τοιούτων
οὐδένος οὐδὲ άπορῶν ἔργου τινος . . . ἐῶ
νῦν ἐπεξιέναι]

Flavio Archippo. Seeon Ep. 58.

exigendam esse rationem operis.
Dio, as having had charge of money
subscribed for a public object, would he
obliged, is required, to render in his ευ-
θύναι. See Schbmann, Antiq. of Graece,
. p. 407. This inquiry would give the
opportunity, even if there had been no
gisappropriation ofthp rrtrpney, tpt critsicise

the commencement. The demand being
made, though it was probably made mali·
ciously,couldnotbutbeallowedbyTrajan.
See Ep. 82, ‘ratio totius operis effecti sub
cura Cocceiani Dionis excutiatur,' etc.

quod aliter fecisset ac debuisset.
In constructing the porticus it was found
’ necessary to pull down a private smithy,

and this was seized as an opportunity by
Dio's enemies to raise the·cry that he
was demolishin the city; although as a
matter of fact the buildrng pulled down
was so mean and low, ‘tiore μήδε τοῖς
χαλκεῦσιν ἐξῆν διάρασθαι σχέδον, άλλά
εἰργάζοντο κεκυφότες) See Or. xl, p.
4 , ‘rai τινες ἦσαν oi σφόδρα ὀδυρόμενοι
τδ χαλκεῖον τδ τοῦ δεῖνος, χαλεπῶς ἔχοντες

εἰ μὴ μενεῖ ταῦτα τά ὑπομνήματα τῇς ·

παλαιᾶς εύδαιμονίᾶς.’

§a in eodem. The reading of
Avantius ‘in aedem,’ or even the emen-
dation of Beroaldus ‘in aede,’ can
hardlybe correct, because Pliny says (ἓ 7)
that the statue was in a bibliotheca:
while the bodies were in the open area.
In eodem would he loosely in ‘the same
building,' by which the accusers wilfully
misrepresented the facts.

tuam statuam et corpora sepui-
torum. This under the νέμοιτε of Ti·
berius or Domitian might have been
magnified into a charge of ‘maiestas'
Cf. Suet. Tib. 58, ‘statuae quidam Au·
gusti caput dempserat, ut alterius im·
poneret . . . Damnato reo, paullatim
hoc genus calumniae eo processit ut haec
quoque capitalia essent; circa Augusti
simulacrum servum cecidisse, vestimenta
mutasse,’ etc. Tac. Amr. i 743 Dio
Cass. 57, 243 and 67, 12, ’γυνὴ γάρ
τις δτι άπεδύσατο ἐνάντιον εἰκόνος τοῦ
Δομιτιανοῦ ἐκρίθη τε καί ἀπώλετο]

53. ad instruendam causam. Cf.
Cic. pro. Cluent. 6. ‘Hoc enim ipsum
iudicium, hoc periculum, illa accusatio,
omnis testium copia. . . a matre hoc
tempore instruitur,' and ‘instruit accusa-
tores, instruit testes'3 also Tac. Ann.
ii 74, ‘qui crimina et accusationem
tanquam adversus receptos iam reos
instruebant) Cic. Vcrr. ii 4, 19, ‘ad
iudicium nondum se satis instruxerat
Dig. 22, 4, 1, ‘instrumentorum nomine
ea omnia accipienda sunt quibus causa
instrui potest; et ideo tam testimonia
