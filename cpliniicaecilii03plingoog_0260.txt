APPENDIX 243

and was therefore directed not against adherents of an illegal religion, ν’] ’
but against members of an unlicensed and forbidden ‘collegium’ ,

These qualifications to Dr. Lightfoot's statement which Ι have quoted
above lead thus to avery practical distinction between his view and that
which Ι have followed He maintains that the events under Nero,
Domitian, and Trajan were all persecutions of the Christians as an
unlicensed religion. Myview is that they should none of them be
called persecutions of the Christians at all, in the first two cases because
the Christians were not recognised as a distinct body as yet, in the last
case, because it wasa mere prosecution under a law against secret associa-
tions, of which the Christian meetings seemed to be aviolation3 and, as Ι

- have pointed out, Trajan’s rescript could only have reference to Plinys
province. Why Dr. Lightfoot should describe it as ‘the most severe of
all the persecutions of which we have any knowledge during the first aud
second centuries,' while admitting that Pliny's correspondence is ‘the
sole ultimate chronicle of this important chapter in the sufferings of the
early Church,' Ι do not understand. Pliny's letter certainly implied that
he had only executed a few, and that as soon as he found that the
number of the accused was becoming considerable, he delayed proceed-
ings till he had consulted the emperor ; and the practical result ofTrajan’s
rescript must have been to stop the persecution, since he forbade any
initiative to be taken by Pliny (conquirendi non sunt), and also any
anonymous accusations (sine auctore propositi libelli in nullo crimine
locum habere debent).

Ι agree therefore on the whole, though from somewhat different
reasons, with Dr. Lightfoot's opinion that ‘as regards Trajan's attitude
towards Christianity‚ the view of the earliest Christian fathers was less
wide of the truth than the view of recent modern critics,' tle. that the
rescript of the emperor inaugurated a new era. It was, it seems tome, s
merely the official interpretation, confirming Pliny's previous action, of
the law against unlicensed collegia So far as it went, however, it was
an edict of proscription against Christianity‚ which by its very essence
was an association and therefore illegal, and if it could be proved that
the rescript was intended to apply to the whole empire, which Ι think
was certainly not the case, it might fairly be described as the initiation -
of an anti-Christian policy. Whether the later and undoubted persecu-
tors, ag. M. Aurelius, Decius, Diocletian, etc, used it as a precedent, Ὑί»
only giving it a general application, is uncertain, but is by no means
improbable.
