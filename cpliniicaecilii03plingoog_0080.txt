INTRODUCTION 63

quite within the competence of the governor to invite accusa·
tions though he could not initiate them. That it actually was
followed by a persecution there is not the smallest proof, and
apart from the question of the martyrdom of Ignatius under
Trajan, which is full of inconsistencies and open to the greatest
doubt, the only evidence for anything of the kind is to be found
in Pliny's own statements of his measures prior to the emperor's
edict. It is this double aspect of Trajan's rescript which, while
it theoretically condemned the Christians, practically gave them
a certain security, that explains the different views which have
since been taken of it; but by most of the Church writers, and
perhaps on the whole with justice, it has been regarded as
favourable, and as rather discouraging persecution than legal-
ising it.

With regard to the application ¹of the edict, I think itis quite
clear that it related not to the empire as a whole, but to Bithynia
only. Trajan’s own words, ‘neque in universum aliquid . . . ’
constitui potest,' partly imply this, but apart from this, without
definite evidence, it would be quite inadmissible to suppose that
arescript given to a particular governor in answer to particular
questions could be applied beyond the province about which it
-was written. That Tertullian and other ecclesiastical writers
should attach as much importance to the correspondence as
they do is natural enough. Trajan’s rescript was called forth
by a letter which might well seem an important and a valuable
one to ‘the whole Christian body, recognising as it does, not
only the number of the sect, but its steadfastness under perse·
cution, and above all its innocence and moral purity; and
exaggerated views in consequence sprang up in early times,
and have to a certain extent continued since, as to the real

importance of the correspondence. Some confirmation of the ,

view taken above, that Trajan's rescript is really little more
than a supplement to his previous edict concerning the hetaeriae ξ
in Bithynia, and really did not touch Christianity as a religion
atall, is perhaps to be found in two statements in the Digest,
one ·of Modestinus, 48, 19-3o,—‘si· quis aliquid fecerit quo
leves hominum animi superstitione numinis terrentur, Divus
Marcus huiusmodi homines in insulam relegari rescripsit';
and one of Paulus, 5, 21, 22, ‘si quis novas sectas vel ratione
incognitas religiones inducat ex quibus animi hominum
