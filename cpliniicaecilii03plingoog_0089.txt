72 INTRODUCTION

However that may be, the discovery of this Bodleian
volume, based as I have shown it to be on the Parisian codex as
copied by Iucundus, makes it impossible to assign the highest
authority to Avantius for Epp. 41·1121; and to Aldus for
1·40, as Keil has done in his critical edition; for evidently
Avantius 4- iucundus is a better authority than Avantius
alone; while the MS. letters, as we have seen, are clearly
earlier and nearer to the codex than Aldus. l therefore take
the Bodleian copy as my principal authority for the textos all
the letters, adopting in some cases, however, the Aldine reading

. in preference, and also modern conjectures in some of the
corrupt passages. ln all such cases the readings will be justi-
fied in the notes. In a very few passages I have ventured to
adopt conjectures of my own: 63§ 3, ‘ad Asiam'3 113,‘ut
praestatione ceteris praeferantur '; 116 ξ 2, ‘at’ for ‘ita’; 121,
‘quae dubitanda fuisset'

In the critical notes I have used the following abbreviations ε
Β. :Bodleian copy; Ald. ¹ = 1st Aldine; Ald. ² = 2d Aldine;
Avant.=Avantius; Cat.=Catanaeus, 15063 Or.:Orelli;
K. = Keil.

ORDER OF THE LETTERS

In this I have followed Keil’s edition, which again has
merely reverted to the order of Avantius and Aldus. This, if
not in every case the strict chronological order of the letters, at
least approximates to it. Thus Epp.1-14 were all written,
probably from Rome, in the earlier partos Trajan's reign, the
latest event referred to in them being Trajan's victory in either
the first or the second Dacian war (Ep. 14) ; while of the later
letters, all written from Bithynia, 17 mentions his arrival in
the province September 111 ; 35 was written in Jan 3, 112 ;
45 probably soon after the beginning of the new year,
when the old diplomata would expire; 52 on the dies imperii,
Jan.27,112; 880n Sept. 15, 1123 and 100 on Jan. 3, 113;
102 on Jan. 27, 113: all the letters with certain dates being
thus in chronological order. Henricus Stephanus was the
first to alter the order of the letters by putting all the single

lettersof Pliny together at the beginning of the book, and
