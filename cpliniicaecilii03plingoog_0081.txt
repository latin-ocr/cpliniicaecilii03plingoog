64 INTRODUCTION

moveantur, honestiores deportentur, tenuiores capite puniantur'
These two rescripts are with much probability taken to refer to
the Christians3 but they would obviously have been entirely
unnecessary if Trajan’s rescript was intended to authorise any-
thing like a general persecution.

Into the question of the authenticity of these two letters I
do not intend to enter. Several of the arguments used against
them are disarmed by the view taken above, others are trifling
and deserve very little weight. Indeed Aube himself in his
Histoire des Persecutiom, after first stating his disbelief that the
Letters as we have them are authentic, and after stating the
principa] difficulties involved in them, discovers difficulties.
equally great in any other view, and in the end appears to
retract his previously-expressed disbelief. What has sometimes
seemed the greatest difficulty is Pliny's statement about the
number of the Christians being so great that the temples were

¹ nearly deserted, whereas it is quite certain, and is even attested
one hundred years later by Origen, that the Christians were

then comparatively few. This difficulty is, I think, much
obviated by three considerations: (1) Pliny, it is true, speaks of
the ‘numerus periclitantium,' and says ‘multi omnis aetatis,
utriusque sexus . . . vocantur in periculum'3 but from a

’ former passage in the letter it is quite clear that a considerable

proportion of these were not Christians and never had been,
but were simply accused by the malice of private enemies3 (2)
even if the temples were nearly deserted, it is not necessary to

y , suppose that Christianity alone was the cause of this, when we
..ἶ remember that the Jews equally with the Christians would

refuse to attend them, and that the former were probably far
more numerous than the latter; and (3) the case with regard
to the temples was probably much exaggerated by those whose
interests were all involved in the temple-worship, like the silver
shrine makers at Ephesus, and who may probably have com·
plained to Pliny that their trade was being ruined.

One other objection may perhaps be mentioned, that Pliny
neither makes any allusion to the Christians in any other letter,
and indeed waits for at any rate more than a year before he
brings the question before Trajan. In answer to this it seems
sufficient to repeat that Pliny began by acting on and enfor-
cing the edict with regard to hetaeriae and did not personally
