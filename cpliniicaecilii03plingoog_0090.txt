EDITIONS CONTAINING THE PLINY-TRAJAN
LETTERS

(1) Hieronymus Avantius of Verona, 15023 containing
41=121 (xxvii-lxxiii), no commentary3 Bodleian.

(2) Philippus Beroaldus, Bononiae, 15023 containing the
same letters3 no commentary; published merely as a supple-
ment to his edition of 1498 ; no copy in England.

(3) Ioannes Maria Catanaeus, Mediolani, 1506, con·
taining the IX books, with the 10 Epp. of viii wanting, and
the same letters (41·121) of the Pliny-Trajan correspondence.
The letters have an elaborate and often valuable commentary,
of which I have frequently made use. The Greek words and
phrases in particular, so faulty in AvantiuS, have received care·
ful correction. British Museum.

(4) 1st Aldine edition, Venetiae, 1508 ; containing for
the first time all the letters, the Pliny-Trajan letters being in-
scribed, probably not on the authority of the codex, Book x.
The letters are not numbered, but are headed by Lemmata,
probably taken from the margin of the codex, as the edition of
Avantius also has them, and also the MS. letters in the Bod-
leian copy; no commentary, British Museum and Bodleian.

(5) Reprint of Catanaeus, unchangcd; Venetiis, 1510.

(6) 2nd Aldine edition, Rheneniana, 1518 ; differs only
slightly from former edition. Bodleian and British Museum.

(7) 2nd edition of CatanaeuS, containing all the letters,
1518, follows the Aldine edition very closely, and giving up a
number of the conjectures and interpolations of the ed. of 1506 ;
no copy in England. See Orelli, Historia Critica.

Later editions containing the text and commentary of
Catanaeus were published in 1519 ; 1553 Par. apud Ascen-
sium; 1552 Basil. apud Froen.; 1600 apud Paul. Stephanum.
