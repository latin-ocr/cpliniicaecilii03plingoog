54 INTRODUCTION

sistent. The Christians, regarded as a sect of the JewS, receive
as such complete toleration both in the provinces and in Rome.
Their converts, many or few, and probably they were still com,-
paratively few, are mostly Jews or Greek freedmen, while though
in the East they were described half in mockery as Christiani, .
there is no evidence that they were known by this name to the
Roman government at all. Indeed, the silence of Seneca, the*
elder Pliny, and Josephus makes it extremely unlikely. .But
after the great lire at Rome, not more than three or four years
' r at most after Paul had been allowed freely to preach his doctrine,
' the position of the Roman Christians was, if we are to believe
Tacitus and Suetonius completely changed. According to the

former (Anu. xv 44) Nero, for the sake of averting suspicion

from himself ‘subdidit reos et quaesitissimis poenis adfecit, quos

per flagitia invisos vulgus Christianos appellabat Auctor nominis

eius Christus, Tiberio imperitante, per procuratorem Pontium

. Pilatum, supplicio adfectus erat3 repressaque in praesens exitia-
bilis superstitio rursum erumpebat, non modo per Iudaeam,

originem eius mali, sed per urbem etiam, quo cuncta undique

atrocia, aut pudenda, confluunt celebranturque. Igitur primum

correpti, qui fatebantur, deinde indicio eorum multitudo ingens,

haud perinde in crimine incendii, quam odio humani generis con-

victi sunt. Et pereuntibus addita ludibria, ut, ferarum tergis con·

tecti laniatu canum interirent, aut crucibus affixi, aut flammati, ι

atque ubi defecisset dies in usum nocturni luminis urerentur! ”

Suetonius (Nero, 16) says more briefiy ‘afflicti suppliciis.

Christiani, genus hominum superstitionis novae ac maleficaes ¹

The questions raised by this account are (1) why should the
Christians, who a few years before, were regarded as a mere
Jewish sect and as such tolerated in Rome, suddenly become
the victims of a fierce persecution‚ and (2) how have the few
converts so soon become an ‘ingens multitudo'? That
Christians were included among the victims of this cruelty is
extremely probable, and was no doubt a tradition among the
early church. But it is deserving of notice that Tacitus used
of the Jews (Hist. v 5) language very similar to that in the
passage quoted above ‘adversus omnes alios hostile odium,’
while Juvenal (xiv 100) brings against them a somewhat similar
charge. At a crisis like that of the great fire, suspicion would
naturally fall on the most fanatical party, and the Jews
