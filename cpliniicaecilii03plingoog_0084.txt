enabled to do this: ‘Ex quo tu e Gallia. . . has Plinii
epistolas in Italiam reportasti, in membrana scriptas, atque
adeo diversis a nostris characteribus ut, nisi quis diu assueverit,
Α non queat legere coepi sperare sore aetate nostra ut plurimi ex
bonis auctoribus, quos non extare credimus, inveniantur'; and
sarther on: ‘Sed tibi in primis habenda est plurima gratia,
inclyte Aloisi, qui exemplar ipsum epistolarum reportasti in
Italiam, mihique dedisti ut excusum publicarem. Deinde
Iucundo Veronensi, viro singulari ingenio ac bonarum literarum ’
studiosissimo, quod et easdem Secundi epistolas ab eo ipso
exemplari a se descriptas diligenter, ut facit omnia . . . ad me
ipse sua sponte. . . adportaverit, idque biennio antequam tu
ipsum mihi exemplar publicandum tradidisses! We are now
better able to understand the vague reference to ‘ Gallia' made
by Avantius. A quotation from Budaeus in his Anaotationes
in pandectas, first published in 1506, will make it clearer still.
In citing from viii 10, he says, ‘Verum haec epistola et aliae
non paucae in codicibus impressis non leguntur; nos integrum
ferme Plinium habemus primum apud Parisios repertum opera

This Ioannes IucunduS, or Giacondo, os Verona, was an

ecclesiastic, scholar, and architect In the latter capacity he was
invited to Paris by Louis XII in 1499 to build the Pont Notre
Dame over the Seine. He was supposed, probably without
reason, to have also built the Pont d’Hotel Dieu, whence the
distich— .

Hunc tu iure potes dicere pontificem!

However, while at PariS, he seems to have discovered this
codex os Pliny's letters (Keil’s family 4), and to have made a
copy ol it, which he sent to Aldus. Another copy ol a portion
of the letters, the first twenty-six being sor some reason which
we cannot determine omitted, had previously been made,
certainly besore 1502, by one Petrus Leander, and by him sent
or brought to Avantius. The original codex, aster having been
used as we have seen by Budaeus, was subsequently, before 1508, ¹
taken to Italy by Mocenigo and given to Aldus, who based his
first edition either on the copy of¹ Iucundus or the original 'codex
or both. Since that time all trace os the original codex has been
