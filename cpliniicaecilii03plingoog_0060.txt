INTRODUCTJON 43

in three of them corrupt motives were the cause of the
acquittal.

The Flavian dynasty found the empire disquieted and
= disorganised owing to the later years of Nero's insane rlgz'me,
and they seem to have infused fresh life and vigour into the
provincial system no less than into the internal administration.
The conferment of the Latin franchise upon the Spanish pro-
vinces as well as the more frequent admission of provincials
into the Roman senate, points to a liberal and judicious policy.
Whether Vespasian had himself set an example of rectitude
in his proconsulship of Africa is doubtful, since while Suetonius
(Vesp. 4) affirms it, Tacitus (Hist. ii 97) as clearly denies it.
Only one case of repetundae is recorded under Vespasian, in
which Antonius Flamma, proconsul of Crete and Cyrene, was
accused by the provincials of repetundae and saevitia, and
condemned (Hz'st. iv 4 5).

Of Domitian, tyrant as he was in Rome in his later years,
it is expressly recorded by Suetonius, that ‘provinciarum prae-
sidibus coercendis tantum curae adhibuit ut neque modestiores
unquam neque iustiores exstiterint,’ and this testimony is at
least negatively confirmed by the fact that only one case of
provincial accusation is known in his reign, viz. that of Baebius
Massa, proconsul of Baetica, who was condemned and his
property confiscated in 93 ΑΙ). (Plin. Ep. vii 33), though the
failure of Tacitus for this period to some extent weakens this
evidence,

It is when we come to Trajan's reign that we really get

most information concerning the trials for repetundae, since .

Pliny's letters admit us to a certain extent behind the scenes.
Altogether there were four cases in the first seven or eight
years of the reign, and in all of them Pliny was engaged. 'lt
is possible that during Nerva’s weak reign, and Trajan's absence
in Germany, the Flavian discipline might seem for a moment
to be relaxed. At any rate, with the exception of two cases in

Bithynia, which, as we know, was in a state of disorganisation,
the other cases, viz. those of Marius and Classicus, occurred at·
the very beginning of Trajan’s reign. Marius Priscus, proconsul ι
of Africa, was accused by one community in the province, and '
a number of individuals (Plin. Ep. iii 9, 2). The provincials
begged that Pliny might be their advocate (ad Trai. 3 a), and he,
