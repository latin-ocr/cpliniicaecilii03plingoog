importance attached to Germany and German affairs by the
Roman statesmanship of the time. During the whole of 98
Trajan remained in Germany. Rome was quiet; the new
emperor had given an example ol firmness by the execution of
the guilty praetorians,1 while he had won the confidence of the
senate by repeating the oath formerly taken by Nerva to put
no senator to death; and his refusal to accept a consulship for
which his absence prevented a personal canvass, appealed
strongly to all those who like Pliny loved the old constitutional
forms.2 During the winter of 98 Trajan seems to have made
a reconnaissance on the Danube, probably in connection with
the recent war with the Suevi,³ and the military roads by which
he intended to connect the Rhine and Danube provinces. But
his presence was now desired in Rome,4 and as he had finished
his work in Germany, and completely restored the discipline
and efficiency of the army, which had been pampered by Dom-
itian,5 thither he proceeded in the course of 99, certainly in time
for the consular elections, at which he was appointed consul for

and his affability and condescension, as well as the tact with

long since impossible. The senators had no means of being
acquainted with the needs of the empire; they were in many
cases provincials, strange to Rome, and completely ignorant
even of the procedure of the senate.8 . But Trajan presided at
their meetings; allowed them to vote by ballot;⁹ consulted
them even on matters of foreign policy; and declared war in
their name. The senate on its part could not sufficiently
express its admiration of so constitutional a princeps‚1⁰eonferred
on him the title of ‘optimus‚’1¹ and was always ready with the
fulsome adulation with which Pliny has made us acquainted.1²
