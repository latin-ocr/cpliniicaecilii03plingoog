24 INTRODUCTION

an augurship vacant on the death of Iulius Frontinus.1 This
was an honour which Pliny had long hoped for, and both
Verginius Rufus,2 and after his death F rontinus,³ had regularly
placed him among the nominees for the next vacancy. On

being released from his duties at the aerarium, Pliny returned
to a certain extent to his practice before the centumviri,4 though
he pleaded less frequently, and evidently contemplated complete Ι
retirement at some future time.⁵ He also acted not unfre-
quently⁶ as assessor, either to the court cf the ‘praefectus urbi‚'⁷
or to the emperor himself,8 who on one occasion sent for him
to his villa at Centumcellae.⁹ The last official duties which
Pliny undertook at Rome were those of ‘curator alvei Tiberis
et riparum et cloacarum urbis,'1⁰ in which office he was con-
sidered to be a colleague once more of his old friend Cornutus,
who was at the same time ‘curator Aemiliae viae.'¹l As'we
have seen, Pliny had made up his mind never again to face
the odium of prosecutinga provincial governor, but his position,
as one of the first pleaders of his day, would hardly permit
him to stand aside from these important political trials alto-
gether, and accordingly we find him in the next few years
, engaged in two cases of the sort, though in both of them on
the side of the defence. Both these trials had reference to
Bithynia. The first, that of Α Iulius Bassus, was probably in
104 AD, the other, that of Varenus Rufus, in 106. Both
cases seem to have been difficult and complicated, and Pliny
did his work thoroughly. In fact, we cannot help suspecting
that he threw his whole ability into the cause of his fellow-
senators if not with greater thoroughness, at least with greater
willingness, than he had shown in behalf of the proconsuls of
Africa and Baetica against their governors. Pliny’s conduct of
these cases probably had an important effect upon his own
career. The trials served not only to give him a very extensive
and accurate acquaintance with the affairs of Bithynia, but they
also convinced the emperor that some thorough reorganisation
was needed in that province, and accordingly, some four or five
years later, probably, in 111 A.D., he appointed Pliny to the
