INTRODUCTION 47

however on the merits oi the case, but on the question whether
the trial should take place or not. He promised ‘explorare
provincialium voluntatem,’ and there, as sar as we know, the
matter rested.
· A consideration oi these four cases leads us to the con-
clusion, to which the cases mentioned more shortly by Tacitus
also point, that, if as a rule substantial justice was done, yet
the senate was by no means an ideal tribunal, that its sym-
pathies were usually on the side of the accused, and that the
punishment inflicted on senatorial offenders was the minimum
which any sense of decency and a regard to the emperor, in
the, background, would permit. Senatorial accuserS, even the
· best oi them, were reluctant to undertake the case os the pro·
vincials (Plini 7, 2; iii 4, 3, and 8: ad Trai. 3 a). If they
undertook it, they were exposed to the secret prayers and the
open resistance of the accused man’s friends (iii 9, 25), to
which, not unnaturally, they often yielded. To a still greater
extent the provincial legati were exposed to these influences
and, ‚as the case of Norbanus (iii 9, 24) and of Theophanes
(iv 9, 20) show, even to greater dangers Again, in its punish·
ments the senate was laudably severe to non-senators like
Priscus and Martianus and Probus and Hispanus (iii 9, 14), but
as lax as they dared to be towards Marius Priscus (cf. Juv. i
50, ‘victrix provincia ploras ³) and the daughter and wife of
Classicus (iii 19, 17) and Bassus

It remains to notice that in certain cases neither the pro·
vincial organisation nor the responsibility os governors proved
themselves adequate to the circumstances os a province, and in
these cases we find that extraordinary missions were sent to
restore order. A minor instance oi the kind occurred under
Ner0, when Polyclitus was sent ‘ad spectandum Britanniae
statum,’ and to compose the quarrel between Suetonius and
his procurator, as well as if possible, to put an end to the
barbarian rebellion. The latter part of this mission not un·
naturally failed, But it was under Trajan that this course was
most frequently adopted. Messius Maximus was sent about
108 A.D. to Achaia, ‘ad ordinandum statum liberarum civi·
tatum’ (Plin. Ep. viii 24). What the particular matters were
which needed rectification in the province we do not know for
certain, but we have sufficient evidence from various sources of
