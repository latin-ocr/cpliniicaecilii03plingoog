selves free from the strict Jewish exclusiveness os the other,
and that Paul was in lact as well as in name the Apostle os ’
the Gentiles, but ln all his missionary journeyS, wherever he
went, there was a Jewish community to which he appealed
first with greater or less success (Acts xxvi 17), and it was cer·
tainly over this Jewish substratum that the Gentile converts
were clustered, the monotheism they accepted was Jewish

. monotheism, and the sacred writings they adopted were the

Jewish books ol the Old Testament. No doubt the spirit and
essence of Christianity differed from that of Judaism‚ that
while the one had the potentiality of becoming a universal
religion, the other could never emerge far beyond the limits of
its own nationality, but this difference except in a sew of the
Christian leaders was below the surlace. It was not alto-
gether the higher features oi Christianity which attracted its
numerous converts whether Jew or Gentile. It was rather its
tendency to level differences of property and distinctions ol
social rank, the hopes it held out oi a coming Saviour, and the
idea of a future beyond the grave in which compensation was
to be hoped for the inequalities oi the present. To the,R0man
proconsuls legates, and procurators‚ whenever their attention
was turned on the Christians at all, they seemed to be merely
a Jewish sect or heresy. Just as Pilate never comprehended‚
nor really cared to comprehend, why the Jews wished to
‘crucify their king,’ so neither dida Gallio or a Felix care to
understand disputes which seemed to relate merely to questions
ol Jewish law.

[At first therefore there seems to be no doubt that to the
Roman government Christianity was merely a Jewish sect,
and shared the same treatment which was accorded to the
¹ Jews. But up to the end of Nero's reign the Jews enjoyed,

* tion. Judaism‚ though not without zeal ior proselytism, was
an exclusive but not an aggressive religion. In Rome there
was already at the beginning of the empire a considerable
number of Jews, living together chiefly in the Transtiberine

quarter. As many as 8000 os them escorted an embassy sent
to Rome by Herod to Augustus. Socially no doubt the Jews
were ata disadvantage; they belonged to the lowest classes;
they were regarded as gloomy, sullen, haters of their kind;
