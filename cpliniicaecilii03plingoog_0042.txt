JNTRODUCTION 25

post of imperial legate of the province, with general instructions
to remedy whatever abuses he might discover, and with a
special mandate strictly to overhaul the financial affairs of the
several communities. How Pliny acquitted himself in this
post, and what the various difficulties and questions were which
he had to confront, will be seen best from his correspondence
with Trajan contained in this volume. How long the appoint-
ment lasted we have no certain means of knowing, but as the
correspondence breaks off somewhat abruptly, and as we have
no traces of Pliny subsequent to it, we may perhaps infer that
it was terminated by his premature death. That he died
previous to 115 A.D. is rendered almost certain from the fact

thatin the great inscription put up after his death, Trajan has
not got the official title either of ‘optimus' or ‘Parthicus'

Such was the public life of Pliny as we can glean it from
his letters, and as we see it summed up in the inscription. For
anything like statesmanship under the empire there was 'no

real room, and even that scope for administrative ability, which
some of the governorships of the large imperial provinces must
have offered, was never presented to Pliny, for the peculiar cir-
cumstances of Bithynia, never a very important province, com-
pelled him at every step to refer apparently simple and ordinary
questions to the emperor. But if Pliny was neithera states-
man nor an administrator, he was a very favourable type of the
cultivated Roman gentleman, interested in all the literary and

capacity for the routine duties of an ordinary senatorial career.
In distinction from his uncle, he is usually known as Pliny the
Consul, but the Pliny whom we know from his letters is much
more the generous friend, the enthusiastic man of lettere, the
amiable patron, and the liberal philanthropist. It has often
been noticed with what different eyes Pliny and Juvenal, who
were nearly contemporaries, looked upon the social features of , ’
their day. This is not, however, altogether wonderful when we '- s
contrast their circumstances in lif. Both came from Italian s
= municipalitieS, but while Juvenal was theson of a freedman, had
his own way to make at Rome, and was to some extent a dis-
appointed man, Pliny had every advantage on his side. He
had, as we have seen, property left him both from his father's
and mother’s family, adjoining the ‘lacus Larius,' in the neigh-
