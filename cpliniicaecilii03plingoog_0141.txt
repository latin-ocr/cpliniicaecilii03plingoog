tion. Domitian had also increased the
pay oi the legionaries by one-fourth.
Suet. Dona 7, “Addidit et quartum sti·
pendium militi, aureos ternos! It was
the turbulente ol the praetorian cohorts
which induced Nerva to adopt Trajan,
who restored discipline among these
troops. Dio Cass. 68, 33 ci. also Plin.
Panegyr. 6, ‘Corrupta est disciplina cas·

tingeres,' and ‘quam speciosum est quod
disciplinam castrorum lapsam exstinctam·
que resovisti depulso prioris saeculi malo!

ut iam-ita nondum. The ita is
wanting in the Aldine ed, which, how·
ever, reads militar i nondum. Casaubon
conjectured ‘ut iam dixerint.'’ D'oring
takes ‘ut dixerunt’ in the sense of
‘postquam dix.' Mommsen conjectures
needlessly ‘etsi adacti erant.’ I have
followed B. in inserting ‘ita’

dixerant sacramento. Previous to
the second Punic war there had been
a distinction between the sacramentum
taken by the newly enlisted troops, and
the voluntary iusiurandum made to the
tribunes. When this, however, was
made compulsory (Liv. xxii 38 ‘milites
tum, quod nusquam antea iactum erat,
iureiurando atribunis militum adacti')
sacramentum was used in general for the
military cath ol allegiance; cs. Caes. Bell.
Ciu. i23. Suet. Claud. 133 Dionys. ιο,
18, ‘dre πάντες ὀμωμὸκοοι τὸν στρατιω-

τικὸν ὅρκον ἀκολουθήσειν τοῖς ὑπάτοις ἐφί

οὓς ἂν καλῶνται πολέμους καὶ μήτε ἁπο-
>teipsa τὰ σημεῖα μήτε ἄλλο πράξειν μηθὲν
ἐναντίον τῷ νὸμῳ. It was originally taken
only ior the coming campaign, and had to

be reuewed to anew commander, ci. Liv.
xxviii 29. Hence under the empire such
phrases as ‘sacramentum Othonis,’ Tac.
Har. i 76, ‘sacramentum Vespasiani,' id.
ib. ii 79. The sacramentum, too, was
regularlyrenewedbyalltbemilitaryiorces
on the ist January each year, Tac. Hist.
i 55, ‘Inferioris tamen Germaniae le·
giones solemni Kalendarum Ianuariarum
sacramento pro Galba adactae’3 also
infra. Ep. 523 on the anniversary oi the
emperor’s accession. Besides the ordinary
phrase 'sacramentum dicere,' Tac. Ann.
i28, ‘sacramento dicere,’ to declare by
means of the oath, osten occurS, etc. Livy
ii24;iv53;xxiv8;xli5. Ctalsaof
the tribunes who administered the oath,
‘sacramento rogare,' Caes. Beli, Gal. iv
125 Livy xl 26, ‘adigere sacramento,'.
Tac. Ann. i 37. Livy iv 5, etc.

ita nondum distributi in numeros
erant. A ‘numerus' in post-Augustali
times was properly a body oi soldiers

’ under the single command of one officer.
trorum ut tu corrector emendatorque con· ,

So centuriae and turmae were not numeri
but cohortes were, cs, Tac. Hist. i 87,
in numeros legionis ; so also was a legion,
Tac. Ama ii 80, in numerum legionis3
ci. ; also Tac. Agn'c. 18, ‘sparsi per pro·
vinciam numeri,’ where it is equivalent to
‘vexillationes'3 also Tac. Hist. i 6,
‘multi ad hoc numeri e Germania ac
Britannia et Illyrico! Ci. Suet. Vespas. 6,
‘revocatis ad officium numeris. See
also Ulpian Dig. 3, 2, 2, 1, ‘exercitum
non unam cohortem neque unam alam
dicimus, sed multos numeros militum’;
‘distribuere in numeros' seems to be
a special phrase sor arranging the re-
cruits or newly appointed officers in the
various legions, so that ‘in numeros’
almost = in the muster-roll. So when
Suetonius wishes to pass on to a friend
the military tribunesbip which Pliny had
procured sor him, Pliny says, Ep. iii 8,
4, ‘ego honestissimae voluntati tuae
pareo. Neque enim adhuc nomen in
numeros relatum est' The reading of
the Ald. etl. ior this was ‘ut iam dixerant
sacramento militar i nondum,’ which 1
have restored irom the Bodleian M.s.,
omitting militari, and inserting ‘ita’
cum pertineat ed exemplum, cf.
v129, 2.
