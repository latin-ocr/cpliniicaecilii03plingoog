Pliny was essentially a man of many friends. To those of
a past generation like Verginius Rufus,2 or Corellius,3 or
Spurinna,⁴ he displays both reverence and affection {his fellow-
townsmen Voconius RomanuS, Calvisius Rufus Caninius Rufus,
and others have always certain claims on his regard; while old
colleagues like Cornutus Tertullus and Calacstrius Tiro are
always spoken of with affection and respect. With the philo-
sophers, Musonius, Euphrates, and Artemidorus, Pliny associated
as much as his official duties would allow. Herennius Senecio
Arulenus Rusticus lunius Mauricus, and Helvidius Priscus 'were
all joined to him by bonds of friendship more or less close.
Martial found in him a kinder patron perhaps than those on
whom he bestows his sometimes fulsome flattery, while between
Pliny and Tacitus there seems to have been a friendship
especially close, and on the side of the former, at least, an out·
spoken and generous admiration. Nothing, indeed, is more
amiable than Pliny’s unstinted praises of his friends. He was
blamed for it by some, but, as he says,⁵ the error, if error it was,
was a happy one. ·1s Pliny was not unwilling that his friends
should make the same mistake with regard to himself, that by
no means implies that his admiration was less than sincere.
Nor amid these literary friendships were his domestic duties
overlooked. Between him and his young wife, Calpurnia, there
was a tender a'nd even a romantic affection ;6 he was always
thoughtful and considerate towards his slaves and freedmen,⁷
and in spite of the allurements of city life, he was never so
happy as when he could get away and rusticate in one of his
many villas. Pliny's life was in almost every respect a happy
one: he was exactly suited to his environme'nt A dabbler in
philosophy, he had no convictions which could have drawn upon
him the sate of Thrasea, or Helvidius, or Rusticus ; an upholder
of senatorial dignity, he had no fruitless longings for a political
liberty and independcnce which might add to that dignity a
more than nominal power, and pure and humane—as his private
life undoubtedly was, he had no objection to a little harmless
