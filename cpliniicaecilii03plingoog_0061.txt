44 INTRODUCTION

though at first reluctant, consented to be nominated. When the
preliminary hearing carne before the senate,Marius pleaded guilty
to the pecuniary offence, and claimed that the matter should be
sent before the iudices Pliny, however, and TacituS, who acted
with him, opposed this, because Marius was accused not only
of extortion but of receiving money sor the death of innocent
persons, and this was beyond the jurisdiction of the quaestio, ⁸
After some discussion it was ,decided that Marius should go ’
before the iudices on the pecuniary charge, but that the more
serious accusation should be tried by the senate. The trial
carne on in January 100 A.D., Trajan himself presiding as
consul. The'occasion was one of unusual importance; Pliny
himself seems to have in some degree shared the feelings of
sympathy and commiseration which the spectacle of Marius, ,
already degraded frorn his senatorial and official dignity raised
in his peers The trial lasted for three days. Two alternative
sentences were proposed (1) that ‘septuaginta millia quae
acceperat Marius aerario inserenda, Mario urbe Italiaque inter·
dicendum'; (2)that ‘septuaginta millia aerario inferenda; Marium

. , repetundarum poenae quarn iam passus esset relinquendum!

The former was carried, while Firminus one of the legates of
Marius, though not expelled from the senate, was precluded
from holding any provincial governorship, a sentence which, as
Pliny points out, was a compromise and inconsistent. '
, In the autumn of the next year, 101 A.D., Pliny was ⁴
requested by ‘legati provinciae Baeticae' to conduct their accusa-
tion against 'Caecilius Classicus, their late proconsul. Again
Pliny hesitated, but again he finally acceded, principally for
three reasons—(1) he felt bound to supplement his pr'evious
advocacy of the province against Baebius Massa3 (2) Classicus
was himself dead, ‘amotumque erat quod in eiusmodi causis
solet esse tristissimum, periculum senatoris’ ;’ (3) he would be able
more easily for the future to excuse himself by compliance
now. The conduct of the case throws much light on the
motives and influences which usually decided such cases. ’
Classicus had held his post in the same year in which Marius
was in Africa, but his probably voluntary death had delayed
the trial for nearly two years He had behaved ‘non minus
violenter quarn sordide,¹ and was accused by the whole pro-
vince. A number of his ‘socii ministrique’ were iucluded in
