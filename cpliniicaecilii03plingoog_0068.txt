were soon supplied. Towns with Greek names and Greek
constitutions arose, such as Pompeiopolis Nicopolis, Megalopolis;
native towns received Greek names, as Gordiukome that of
Iuliopolis Bithynium that of Claudiopolis, Krateia that of
Flaviopolis and as it was proved in Thrace proper, the substratum
of Thracian nationality gave afavourable ground for Hellenistic
culture to grow upon, and names like Cocceianus Dio of Prusa,
Memnon of Heraclea, Arrian of Nicomedeia, and Dio Cassius
of Nicaea prove that the province fairly held its own in literary
studies.

PLINY AND THE CHRISTIANS

A clear understanding of the various questions raised by
Pliny's letter and Trajan’s rescript on the subject of the Chris-
tians in Bithynia, can only be gained by a retrospective glance
at the relations which had existed between the Christians and
the imperial government during the first century. This, how-
ever, is not altogether an easy task, because on the one hand
the period covered by the author of the Acts of the Apostles
does not extend beyond 62 or 63 A.D.‚ during which time the
points ol contact between the new religion and the government
were few and incidental, while on the other hand the contem·
porary Roman writers are for the same reason entirely silent
about the ChristianS, who are not mentioned at all before the
first or second decade of the second century, and even then
we are not sure how far Tacitus and Suetonius in relating the
events of Nero's reign are speaking of the Christians from the
' point· of view of their own time. However, from the Acts of
the Apostles several points are quite clear. Not only did
Christianity emerge from Judaism in the first instance, but the·
first and indeed the only condition of its extension beyond
its original birthplace was the widespread dispersion of the
Jewish nation. Not without reason Josephus asserted that
there was no people in the earth where Jews were not found
(Bell. [aa 2, 16, 4), and on the very first occasion on which
the new religion was preached, it was to an audience of ‘de-
vout jews frorn every nation under heaven' (Acts ii 5-11).
lt is perfectly true that under the influence of Paul one of the
two parties into which Christianity was soon divided set thern·
