it at an auction in Oxford in 1708, and as, though mentioning the
rarity of the edition in a note on the same page, he makes no
allusion to the MS. part of it,I imagined at first that some
previous owner had, to make a complete copy of Pliny, copied
the missing letters in MS. from some later edition. But when
out of curiosity I endeavoured to discover what edition he had
used, 1 was struck (1) with several readings in which the MS.
agrees with the first Aldine, but which have never been repeated in
later editions, a fact which seemed to show that the original of
the MS. was not later than the first Aldine, and (2) what was more
important, that in a number of cases it differed both from the
first Aldine and from all later editions, and (3) that it contained
correct readings in anticipation of conjectures made by Casaubon,
Perizonius, Schaeffer, and Orelli. Beginning then to suspect
that the MS. was older than the first Aldine edition, I ex·
amined it with greater care, and all the more εο, as I found on
the last page of the edition of Avantius the following words
written in the same handwriting as the marginal readings through·
out the book. ‘Hae Plinii iunioris epistolae ex vetustissimo
exemplari Parisiensi et restitutae et emendatae sunt opera et
industria Ioannis Iucundi praestantissimi architecti hominis
imprimis antiquarii! The real value of this Bodleian copy can
of course be properly estimated only by a thorough collation of
all its marginal readings, as well as of the MS. letters in Book
viii and the Pliny-Trajan letters, with Aldus. The results and
analysis of this collation I have given in the Journal of Philology,
vol. xvii, No. 33, where 1 claim to have made out the following
points (1) that the MS. portion of the book is the oldest authority
extant for the letters contained in it, being taken from Iucundus'
copy of the Parisian codex; (2) that the marginal readings,
chiefly though not exclusively found in the printed parts of the
book are also taken from this copy 3 and (3) that the book in its
present form is the copy of Aldus himself, from which the first
proof ο[ his edition was printed.

The first point is established by acollation of the MS. letters
with Aldus, who in the case of the Pliny-Trajan letters has
hitherto been the earliest authority.
