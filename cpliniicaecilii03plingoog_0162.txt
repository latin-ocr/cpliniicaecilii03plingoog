tium first came into contact with Rome
in the Macedonian wars, when it became,
but onl temporarily. and because there
was at tbat time no province in its neigh-
bourhood, a ‘civitas foederata,' Tac.
Ann. xii 62, ‘Byzantii . . . orsiafoedere
quod nobiscum icerant, qua tem estate
bellavimus adversust em Mac onum,
cui ut degeneri Pseudoplrilippi vocabulum
impositum! Later they helped Rome
against Antiochus and Perseus, and fur-
mshed assistance to the elder Antonius
against the pirates, to Sulla, LuculluS,
and Pompeius. After Macedonia was
organised as a province, Byzantium seems
to have been subject to its proconsul,
not, however, any longer as a ‘civitas
foederata' It was nowa‘civitas libera,'
ae. its freedom did not depend ona
definite foedus, and might be revoked

veno. i p. 77) Cic. z'n Pis. iii 6, with
reference to Byzantium, ‘omitto iurisdie-
tionem in libera civitate contra leges sena·
tusque consulta' and again, ‘ipsam vero
urbem Byzantiorum fuisse refertissimam
atque ornatissimam signis, quis ignorat?

simo et taeterrimo, civitas libera et proxi-
mis suis beneficiis a senatu et a populo
Romano liberata, sic spoliata et nudata
est ut,’ etc At what date Byzantium
was assigned to Bithynia is uncertain.
Probably when Macedonia, under Au-
gustus, eeased to be a frontier province,
the military protection over Byzantium
passed to Moesia, while as far as admin-
istration was concerned it formed part
of Bithynia ,In 53 au. the Byzantrnes
were a tributary city, and were certainly
in a senatorial province, and therefore

zantii. . . curn magnitudinem onerum
apud senatum deprecarentur, cuncta
repetivere. . . . Ita tributa in quinquen-
nium remissa?’' Pliny, h.n. iv 11, speaks
of Byzantium as ‘oppidum liberae con·
ditionis,’ but we know from Suetonius,
Vespas. 8, that its ‘libertas' was taken
away by Vespasian. It had, however,
regained this before the tinre of Severus,
who again took it away as well as its

separate town-existence, for its adhesion
to Pescennius Niger; Dio Cass. 74, 14,
‘travae δὲ τὴν πόλιν τῆς τε ἐλευθερίας καὶ
τοῦΙάξιώματος τοῦ acheriani! Another
example of the vicissitudee of a free town
is Cyzicus, which became ‘libera’ after
the Mithridatic wars3 lost its freedom

15 aa, Dio Cass. 54, 233 and again
lost it under Tiberius, Tac. Ann. iv 363

were sent to Rome on various missions
both by the provinces and by the muni-
cipal towns. In the former case they
were elected hythe ‘concilium provin-
ciae,’ in the latter by the ‘decuriones ’ς
cf. Plin. Ep. vii 6, ‘ adest provinciae lega·
tus, attulit decretum concilii ad Caesarem.
The votes of thanks, ‘laudationes' which
had formerly been conveyed to Rome on
the departure of the governor, Cic. Verr.
ii 4, 5, and ad Fam. iii 8, were put an ,
end to by N ero; Tac. Ann. xv 22, ‘Mox
auctore principe sanxere ne quis ad con·
cilium sociorum referret agendas aud
senatum propraetoribus pro ve consulibus
grates, neu quis ea legatione fungeretur!
For these legationes there was as arule
no direct remuneration, and they were
looked upon as burdens. Those who
had the ‘ius trium liberorum' were
exempt. Vespasian limited the number
sent by any state to three; Dz'g. 58, 5,
‘Praecipitur autem edicto divi Vespasiani
omnibus civitatibus ne plures quam ternos
legatos mittant’ A legatus, from the
time of his appointment (legato tempus
prodest ex quo legatus creatus est, non
ex quo Romam venit) could undertake

no private business (‘qui legationis officio .

fungitur, suum negotium curare non po-
test’), Dig. 50, 7. Cf. Tac. Ann. xvi 5,
‘ uique per longinquas provincias. . .
oiiicio legationum advenerant!
nummorum duodena milla. This
was the legativum or legatorum viaticum,
which was no doubt calculated on a
ruinously extravagant scale; ng. 50,
