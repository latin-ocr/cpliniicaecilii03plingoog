INTRODUCTION 33

to be quadruple, and besides banishment for serious cases
intestabilitas and expulsion from the senate were apparently
ipso facto the consequences of conviction. This, as we
should expect from its author lulius Caesar, was a far more
thoroughgoing measure than the preceding laws, and in spite
of its author, Cicero’s admiration of it is unqualifred (Cic. pro

Sest. 643 in Pis. 12). But, as has been hinted, the lex Iulia
was an imperial more than a republican measure, and through-
out all the early empire it remained the basis of the procedure
taken in cases affecting the provincial governors. Far more
important, however, than any change in the mere letter of the law
was the change of spirit and intention which the Augustan
system introduced into the provinces (Suet. Aug. 593 Dio
Cass. 51, 20), ‘the periphery’ of the empire to which its centre
of gravity was destined gradually to shift from Rome the
capital. The policy of Augustus, which he consistently main-
tained throughout his reign, may be summed up in the words,
‘pax Romana ³—peace and security on the frontiers undisturbed
recuperation and development within. How zealously he
strove to improve the condition of the provinces is shown by
the eleven years which he spent away from Italy, not often at
the head of his armies, for that task he left to Agrippa and
Tiberius, but in the work of organisation and the removal of
abuses In Bithynia alone, a comparatively unimportant pro-
vince, we find in Pliny’s letters mention of at least two edicts
of Augustus and we cannot doubt that in other provinces as.
well his attention and care were similarly displayed. But the
provincial administration could not depend on the personal
presence of the emperor, which was of course mainly required
at Rome. What was wanted was reduction to a system in
the first instance, and the means of checking and regulating
the system afterwards Accordingly, one of the first things
which occupied Augustus after Actium was the regulation
of the provinces and their distribution between himself and the
senate. The settled and peaceful provinces, usually well inside
the frontiers, where Romanisation had already made some
advance, and where the presence of legions was not necessary,
were assigned to senatorial administration. The other pro·
vinces, whether on important frontiers or newly acquired, or
needing for any reason a permanent army, he reserved for his
