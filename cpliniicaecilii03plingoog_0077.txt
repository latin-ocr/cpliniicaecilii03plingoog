relation to the Christians. In all these provinces the Jewish

ι population was very considerable, while it is easy to believe,
even apart from the evidence of Pliny, that the Christians were

also becoming numerous, and in view of the bitter hatred which
existed between Jews and Christians since the Jewish war, it must

have become impossible for the Roman governors any longer to
confuse the two. But the Jews were probably still the most
numerous and as their religion was still tolerated, there seemed

no reason sor special measures against the Christians, and it
would be deemed sufficient to check with a firm hand any
riotous behaviour on the part of either. This, it is probable,

f was the state of things up to the end of Domitian's reign.
The Christians,.though increasing in number, were still mainly
members of the lower classes, as is proved almost certainly from

the fact that up to and beyond this period all the Christian
bishops are shown by their names to be peregrini; but they

were gradually being ¹forced upon the attention of the provin·

cial governors partly by their numbers, but much more so
perhaps by the accusations which their Jewish enemies would

make against them. That the scandalous stories commonly

«ψ’ believed about the Christians were the result of Jewish infor-
! mation and Jewish malevolence is extremely probable; and
'ur NJ J both in the other oriental provinces and in Bithynia, where the
¹ ι Jews even from the time of Cicero (pro Flac. cap. 28), had
been exceptionally numerous, it is likely that Christians may

for some years have been charged by the Jews, and occasionss

ally brought before the tribunal of the governors, on some
charge of impiety or sacrilege, or possibly even maiestas. It

is to cognitiones of this sort before the provincial tribunals that

I believe Pliny to refer when he states, ‘cognitionibus de Chris-

tianis interfui nunquam.'' Up to the date of his letter, how·

,l ever, they had not attracted much attention, nor had the real

i difference between Jews and Christians yet fully penetrated to
Rome. But many things which had passed almost unnoticed

« under the lax ragime of the senatorial'proconsuls at'once
¹ would attract the attention os Pliny, and by him be brought
under the notice of Trajan. Among other things the existence

of collegia or sodalitates, always liable to abuse‚ had, in certain

of the cities of Bithynia especially, led to sactions and disturb-

ances (ad Trai. 34). F or this reason Trajan refuses even to allow
