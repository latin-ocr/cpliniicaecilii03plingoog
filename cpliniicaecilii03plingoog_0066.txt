own province, the mission imposed by Trajan was formally
ratified bya senatus consultum. What sort ol work it was
that needed to be done in Bithynia, we know from the Letters.
It is only necessary to repeat that, though we may learn from
this correspondence the spirit which animated Trajan in pro-
vincial matters, we cannot infer that he was personally con·
sulted to the same extent in the caseos other provinces which
were under their own normal ragime. The necessary resorms
in Bithynia were not completed by Pliny, for we find that his
colleague in the consulship, C. Iulius Cornutus Tertullus, was
still later⁴ in Trajan's reign (the emperor has the title Par·
thicus) sent to Bithynia also as ‘legatus Augusti pro praetore’
(Orell. 3659), while later still Tiberius Iulius Severus was
sent there under Hadrian, with the title of διορθωτὴς καὶ
hoylande. These were the small beginnings of the tendency
towards a central bureaucracy, which before long filled the
provinces and Italy with imperial curatores and correctores,
and at last culminated in the Diocletian system.

THE PROVINCE OF BITHYNIA AND PONTUS

Bithynia, the region between the rivers Rhyndacus and
Sangarius was left to the Roman people by the testament of
Nicomedes ΙΙΙ in 74 B.C., and at once reduced to the form of
a province (Liv. Ep. 9 3 ; App. Bell. civ. i 111). N ine years
later, in 65 B.C., after the third Mithridatic war, Pompeius
added to this the western portion of the kingdom of Pontus
from Heraclea to the Halys (Liv. Ep. 102; Strab. 12, p. 544).
Following the policy of the Romans, who in all these provinces
aimed at making towns the units of administration, Pompeius
divided the Roman portion of Pontus into eleven town com-
munities, each with an extensive rural district, resembling in
this respect the Gallie cantons. Among these were Heraclea,
Tium, Amastris, Abonoteichos, Sinope, and Amisus. Bithynia
was divided, according to Pliny (h. n. 5, 143), into twelve
similar communities-Nicomedeia, Nicaea, Cius, Apamea, Tius, k
Prusias or Hyppias, Chalcedon, Claudiopolis, Crateia·Flavi-
opolis, Iuliopolis, and Dascylium. The two districts from the
beginning formed one province, though they retained a certain
