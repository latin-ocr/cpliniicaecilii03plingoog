a fire bngade to be formed at Nicomedeia; and 1t appears from μ yffi,
Pliny’s letter about the Christians, that a general edict had
been issued forbidding m Bithynia hetaeriae of all sortS, ‘post
edictum meum quo secundum mandata tua hetaerias esse vetu-
eram.’ rViewed in the light of this edict, the charges brought
before Pliny, as before previous proconsuls, against the Chris·
tians would assume amore important aspect Inquiry would
show that in many respects the organisation of the Christian
congregation was similar to that of the various collegia, which,
primarily intended as benefit societies or funeral clubS, each
had, as the Christians also had, their common treasury, their
common cult, and their fixed religious celebratione Looked
at as individuals charged with ill-will or disaffection to estab-
lished usages and rites, the Christians might be regarded as
misanthropes as haters of the human race ; they might even
be suspected of 'various enormities at their secret meetings:‚
but once regard these misanthropes as members ofa body, and
their corporate ill-will to the usages of the ruling people becomes
no longer misanthropy, but conspiracy. This is what would
strike Pliny more than anything else, when the ordinary accu-

or less trumpery charges brought against the Christians; on
the other was the fact already placed before him, that the
accused formed a society, and in some respects a secret society,
described by a common name. Which was he to regard as the
more important, the ‘nomen' or the ‘crimina nomini cohae-

the ‘nomen' the profession, the membership in the society,
which is the serious charge; and as such membership, after the
edict referred to, involved direct disobedience, as it further was
accompanied by a refusal to worship the state gods, or to do
homage to the emperor’s statue, Pliny considered that, leaving
out of account the details charged against them, he had no
choice but to visit this obstinacy with the extreme penalty.
He however punishes them not as members of a religious sect,
butas members of a suspicious and at any rate forbidden asso·
ciation. It is clear that this severe course, necessary as it
seemed to Pliny in the circumstances, did not quite commend
itself to his humanity, because (1) certain inquiries which he
