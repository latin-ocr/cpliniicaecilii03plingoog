μητρόπολις 01 Bithynia, Amastris had the same title in Pontus,
and in these two cities respectively met the consilia or κοινά
01 Bithynia and Pontus The constitution of the whole pro·
vince depended on the lex Pompeia, or the arrangement made
by Pompeius in 65 B.c. The great majority 01 the towns were
the ordinary, unprivileged ‘civitates stipendiariae,' subject in all
respects to the proconsul’s interserence. Of colomes in Trajan’s
time there were only two, Apamea (Plin. h. n. 5, 149 ; ad Trai.
47) and Sinope (Plin h. n. 6, 6), while there were two ‘civitates
liberae et foederatae,' Chalcedon (Plin. h. n. 5, 149), and Amisus
(ad Trai. 92). It is noticeable that Byzantium, though on the
Europeanside 01 theStraits,belonged administrativelyto Bithynia.

Prior to the Augustan regulation of the provinces, Bithynia
was governed by a propraetor, but after 27 B.C. it, as a
senatorial province, was subject to a proconsul. Of its various
proconsuls we know Granius Marcellus, under Tiberius (Tac.
' Arm. i 74); Cadius Rufus, under Claudius (Arm. xii 22);
Tarquitius Priscus, under Nero (Ana. xiv 46); Appius
Maximus under Domitian (ad Trai. 58) ; Tullius Iustus, under
Nerva (ad Trai. 58); Iulius Bassus, Varenus Rufus, and Ser-
vilius Calvus (ad Trai. 56), under Trajan. These proconsuls
had 01 course their quaestors for the linances of the aerarium,
and as praetorii, their one legatus. But as there were imperial
domains in the province, and as such taxes as the ‘vicesima
hereditatum,’ etc, went to the fiscus, there were even under the
senatorial agitne always imperial procurators (Henz. 5530,
6940 ; Tac. Ann. xii 21). The old inhabitants 01 Bithynia
were 01 Thracian nationality, and previous to the Roman ’
occupation‚ Greeks, though no doubt numerous in the country,
had failed to spread Hellenistic civilisation to any great ex-
⁶tent, nor were Greek towns even on the coast, at all numerous.
Indeed such towns as Sinope and Amisus, originally 01 Greek
foundation, had lost some 01 their Greek character by becom-
ing the royal residences 01 the Pontic kings. The native kings
of Bithynia and Pontus, though not without Hellenistic culture,
stood in this respect far behind the courts 01 Pergamus and
Antioch, and up to the time of the empire the inland parts 01
the country were not only without much civilisation‚ but even
without towns. After the Roman conquest both deficiencies
