36 INTRODUCTION

Roman citizens, possessed the power of life and death. For
his use of this power, however, he was liable· to be accused, as,
ag. Volesus Messalla, proconsul of Asia, was in the time of
Augustus (Tac. Arm. iii 68, and Sen. de Ira. ii 5). Naturally,
as the Roman franchise was extended, the criminal jurisdiction
of the provincial govemors assumed continually narrower pro-
portions Generally speaking, the senatorial provinces, being
only indirectly under the emperor's eye, were administered
with comparative laxity. F lagrant abuses no doubt were quite
exceptional, but the annual change of govemors the appoint-
ment by lot, senatorial larissea-farre, rendered impossible the
experience, the special fitness, and the alertness which mark
the imperial governors. We find in Bithynia, which is only a
type of the class, embarrassed financeS, misapplieation of re·

official titles or dignity, For whether consular or praetorian,
they were merely the mandatories of an executive power higher

to and not possessing proconsular power they could only be ·
propraetore, while, as chosen by the emperor himself, they were
legati Augusti pro praetore. This inferior dignity, however, ⁴

marked by their having five fasces only, was more than com·
pensated by their greater actual powers especially in military
matters A legate to Britain or Upper or Lower Germany or
Syria might have as many as four legions with a corresponding
number of auxiliary troops under his command. As legati or
deputies, however, they could not appoint legati under them-
selves, and the legati legionum, or in later times the legati
iuridici, who assisted them in matters military and judicial,
were appointed like themselves by the emperor. An en·
