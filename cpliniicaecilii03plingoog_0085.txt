lost. It has never been used by any editor of Pliny since the
first Aldine edition, for though Catanaeus in the preface to his
second edition of 1518 talks of having seen ‘descriptas de
vetussimo codice germanico plures ad Traianum et insuper
quasdam eiusdem Plinii ad amicos epistolas,' his text slavishly
follows the first Aldine published ten years before, and we can
hardly aequit Catanaeus of wilfully ignoring this edition, and
attempting to give a factitious originality to his own edition by
this mention of the supposed ‘codex germanicus? The only
original authorities therefore for the Pliny-Trajan letters have ,
hitherto been the edition of Avantius for Epp, 41·121, taken
from a copy of the Codex Parisiensis made by Petrus Leander,
and the first Aldine edition for the whole, taken froma copy of
the codex made by iucundus, and possibly from a collation of
the codex itself Keil in his restoration of the original text
has taken Avantius as his first authority for those letters contained
in the edition, and the Aldine edition necessarily sor the rest.
His opinion, however, os the trustworthiness of Aldus, in spite
of the materials at his disposal, is not very high. He believes

⁸ that for the previously published letters Aldus did very little

more than alter the edition of Avantius by emendations and

⁴ interpolations of his own, while for the before unpublished letters

he believes that he has followed the MS. less accurately than
Avantius had sor the others. I have now to mention a discovery
which Ι have been fortunate enough to make quite recently in
the Bodleian library, and which will, I believe, make it necessary
somewhat to modify Keil's view of the Aldine edition, and at
the same time will give us an earlier authority for the missing
letters both of Book viii and of the Pliny-Trajan correspondence
than the Aldine edition. On consulting the Bodleian copy of
Avantius 1 found (1) that it was bound up together with the
edition of Beroaldus of 1498 ; (2) that the missing letters in
both editions, ie. viii 8, §3-18§ 11 in the latter, and 1-40
of the Pliny-Trajan letters in the former, were added in MS. in
Carolingian minuscules on paper similar in size and appearance
to that os the printed editions ; (3) that the whole book, both
printed and MS. portions, had in the margin a number of

variant readings, in the same handwriting, and that very
marked and striking. The book, it appeared from the title-
page, had belonged to Thomas Hearne the antiquary, who bought
