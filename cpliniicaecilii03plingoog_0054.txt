tirely independent authority in the imperial provinces within
. a certain limited department, was the procurator, who had the
sole charge os the financial affairs of the province-os every-
thing in fact which related to the fiscus Procuratores there
were in the senatorial provinces to look after the interest of the
fiscus there, and the emperor’s private affairs, and in the ngest,
i 18, 9 the proconsul is specially warned to keep clear of all
fiscal matters3 but‘it is in the imperial provinces that the pro·
curator holds a really important post. To the native Britons
the legatus and the procurator seem like two kings-the one
with power over their lives, the other over their properties
(Tac. Agrz'c. 15). Too often the legate and the procurator
were on unfriendly terms Nero had to send Polyclitus to
compose a quarrel in Britain between Suetonius Paulinus and
the procurator Classicianus, while it is mentioned of Agricola
as something noteworthy that he had no such quarrel. lt was
not even unknown for the emperor to use the procurator as an
instrument against and a spy upon the doings of the legate
(Suet. Galb. 9). That the imperial provinces were well ad·
ministered there can be little doubt. On not more than two
or three occasions shall we find any of the imperial legates
accused by the provincials, and though from their position at
‘ the head ol considerable armieS, they might at exceptional
crises be the cause of civil war, in ordinary times and under
efficient emperors this was a danger which in the first two
centuries need hardly be taken into account.

As we should expect, the provinces welcomed this change
of system (Tac. Anu. i 2, ‘Neque provinciae illum rerum statum
· abnuebant ’), in which both the motives and to some extent
the opportunities os wrong-doing were taken away. A fixed
salary was now given to all provincial governors (Dio Cass
53, 153 52, 233 Tac. Agric. 423 Ann. xv 19) sufficient to
make provincial posts desirable apart from any opportunity
of illicit gain, while, as an additional safeguard, it was made
the rule in the second century that no one should be the
governor os the province in which he had been born (Dio
Cass. 71, 31), or, as is at any rate true at the end of the first
century, in which he had served as military tribune. It must
be added that the personal supervision of the emperor was, im·
mensely facilitated by the systematic construction of roads
