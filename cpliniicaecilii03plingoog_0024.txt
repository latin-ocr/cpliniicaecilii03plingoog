the spoils which presently came in from the Dacian wars, the balance
would decidedly be in favour of the administration, the economy of
which lwas increased by a financial commission appointed from the
senate.

'With the year 101 the second part of Trajan's reign
began. His power was consolidated in Rome, and he was
able to tum his attention to foreign affairs. Of these by far
the most pressing were the relations with the barbarian tribes

· on the Danube. Domitian's Dacian war had lest these in a

· most unsatisfactory state. In spite of the nominal triumphos
91 A.D.‚ the position ol Decebalus was hardly weakened, while
his purchase of warlike machines and other preparations
pointed to a speedy renewal of the war. Trajan determined
by prompt action to establish the same security along the
Danube which the Rhine provinces now enjoyed. Whether
he had determined at the outset to annex Dacia, or whether
he contemplated only the reduction of Decebalus to the posi-
tion ofa client king, we cannot say. The details of the wars ’
are imperfectly known. The sullest account was probably that
of Dio Cassius, who, having himself been legate of Pannonia,
must have had the opportunity of getting precise information;
but the abridgment os his lost work by Xiphilinus, our chief ls ¹
historical authority, is both meagre and inexact as to the order
of events. However, by taking this as the basis, and using all
the side lights thrown on the subject by inscriptions, medals‚
and traces of roads, and above all by the Columna Traiana at
Rome, a fairly clear account of the general course of the wars
has been rendered possible. Starting from Rome in March of
101,2 in which year he was Cos. 1v.,³ Trajan proceeded to
Viminacium in Upper Moesia. A road had been already made
by his orders along the right bank of the Danube, while a
bridge of boats was prepared at Lederata. In all probability
the invasion of Dacia was made at two points. While Trajan
himself, with the Pannonian army under the legate Glitius
Agricola, proceeded through the Banat past Berzovia and
Anius? and through the Iron Gate, the Moesian army under
M' Laberius passed through little Wallachia and joined the
