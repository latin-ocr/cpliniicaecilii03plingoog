2 pignera privatis cumulat officiis. Rogo ergo ut ipse apud te
pro dignitate eius precibus meis faveaS, cui et, si quid mihi crediS,
indulgentiam tuam dabis. Dabit ipse operam ut‘ in iis quae ei
mandaveris maiora mereatur. Parciorem ¹me in laudando facit
quod spero tibi et integritatem eius et probitdtem et industriam
non solum ex eius honoribus quos in urbe sub oculis tuis gessit,
verum etiam ex commilitid esse notissimam ’ Illud unum, quod
propter caritatem eius no'ndum mihi videor satis plene fecisse,
etiam atque etiam facio teque, domine, rogo gaudere me exor-
nata quaestoris mei dignitate, id est per illum mea, quarn

maturissime velis.

Cass 60, 24 ‘roh μὲν οῦν rapidae τὴν join to ‘tuam’; and translate ‘I beg you
διοίκησιν ἀντὶ τῶν ἀρχῶν τῶν ἐντῇἸταλίᾳ therefore personally to attend to my

time they seem to have assisted the consuls my recommendation, you wilf also grant

were always regarded as in a semi-filiai ut maiora mereatur to deserve still
relation to their consuls or proconsuls‚ higher promotion.

privatis cumulat offlolls. Pliny’s
letters show that they were on intimate
terms. Geminus tells Pliny that his books
are sold in Lugdunum, somewhat to his
surprise ‘bibliopolas Lugduni esse non
putabam' Ep. ix Π.

§a utipsoapudte. . . indulgentiam
tuam dabla. There are several difficul-
ties in this passage, and probably the read·
. ing may be partly corrupt. ‘Apud te’
and ‘oul et’ are especially hard to explain.
Diiring supposes a strong antithesis be·
tween ‘ipse apud te precibus meis faveas ’
and ‘cui et indulgentiam tuam dabis,’ the
former being a request for Trajan’s good
opinion of Rosianus, the latter for some
positive promoti0n‚ the ‘et' having a
heightening force. But ‘ipse apud te' is a
very awkward expression or ‘ in your own
mind' and the ‘ preces’ are certainly not
for Trajan’s good opinion, but for his
‘indulgentia¹; ‘pro dignitate’ again does
not mean ‘as his worth deserves,’ but ‘ in
a manner commensurate with his station.’
Precibus meis faveas, and indulgentiam
tuam dare, must be taken as synonymous
expressions, the latter serving somewhat
clearly to define the former. Ι should
prefer to take ‘ipse apud te’ as by your
personal intervention '; the ‘ et' 1 should

or aedile, in either case after a full year's
interval ; he may also possibly have been
praetor during the interval before the
date of this letter, and Pliny may be ask·
ing sor some praetorian appointment for
him suchas ‘legatio legionis! ,

sen supposes that Rosianus was tribunus
militum in the Dacian wars; but the
military tribuneship was held before and
not alter the quaestorship, cf. the case
of Trajan himself and Pliny. See also
Plin. Ep. vi 31, 4, and therefore it seems
best to refer the commilitium to Tra'an’s
command in Upper Germany. Or osi·
anus may have served in the Dacian wars
as praefeet of an auxiliary cohort.
