own regulati0n; while again a third class of smaller dis·
tricts hc either left to client-kings, or if this laxer bond was
tightened by a regular provincial organisation, assigned
to the charge oi his own procurators. Within this general
scheme the details of rank and privilege, of duty and re-
sponsibility, of subordinate and c0·ordinate power, were care-
sully defined, as carefully and thoroughly in their way as the
much more complex system of Diocletian was three hundred
years later.

In theory all provincial rule depended in the last resort
on the senate, for it was involved in the proconsular imperium
which the senate alone could confer. But this imperium
was conferred once sor all, and with no restriction of place,
on the emperor, who thus had all the provinces potentially
under his direct control. In practice, however, by the
arrangement of 27 B.C., the senate was allowed to confer the
proconsular power, though strictly limited, in time and place, .
on the governors os those provinces which were assigned
to their administration. Hence the governors os all senatorial ¹
provinces were proconsuls. They were not subordinated to
any higher executive authority, theoretically not even to the
emperor, whose proconsular imperium was constitutionally
co-ordinate with theirs They were equally proconsuls
whether it was Sardinia or Corsica which they governed, or
large and important provinces like Asia or Africa. In either
case they were appointed by the senate and by lot, and held
office for a single year only. For two provinces only, Asia
and Africa, was full consular rank a necessity, and the pro-
consuls of those provinces were dignified with twelve fasces
The other provinces were held by men of praetorian rank, who
only were entitled to six fasces¹ There was no incapacity in
the senatorial proconsuls to command an army, andin certain
cases they might have legionary troops, as, eg. till the time of
Caligula, the proconsul ol Africa actually had. But in the

, military command the principle of c0·0rdinati0n was under

the empire unknown. Everything depended on the emperor's
will, and practically the proconsuls and the senatorial provinces
had no troops except occasional ‘vexillationes' from the legions
and auxiliaries. Even in the matter of the military levy, or
conscription which, during the first century, was conducted sor
