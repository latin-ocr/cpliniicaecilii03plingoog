2 INTRODUCTION

post of proconsul of Asia.1 The young Trajan therefore
entered upon the ordinary career open to youths of senatorial
family with somewhat more than ordinary prospects. Of
his boyhood and youth we have no information. He entered
the army as military tribune perhaps earlier than was
usual, and before he had gone through anything like a
thorough course of rhetorical training‚2 a deficiency which did
not seriously affect his later career. Nor was his the ordinary
‘semestris militia' of the senatorial youth. Entering the service
probably in 68n1), he seems to have served under his father
in the Jewish war, while in the course of the ten campaigns
which Pliny mentions3 he served on the Rhine in Lower
Germany,4 and, as we have already seen, was engaged in his
father’s Parthian campaign in 75 or 76 A.D, During these
years, we may well believe, apart from Pliny's exaggerated ex-
pressions, that Trajan showed those qualities which afterwards
made him the hero of his soldiers. In 78, with a military ex-
¹perience and reputation greater than that of most of his con-
temporaries Trajan returned to Rome, and during the last years
of Vespasian, and the short reign of Titus, he was successively
passing through the ordinary ‘cursus honorum3’ first the.
quaestorship, then either the tribunate of the plebs or the curule
’ aedileship, and then the praetorship, The latter office he almost
certainly held in 85 A.D., for Spartian⁵ mentions him as ‘prae- ’
torium tunc' in Hadrian's tenth year (86 ΑΒ.) Of his conduct
Α in these offices we know nothing; the times were not stirring,
and he was probably as {unobtrusive as Tacitus describes ⁵
Agricola to have been. Owing to this necessary residence in
the city, Trajan lost the chance of distinguishing himself in
Domitian’s war against the Chatti (8 3-84), but after his prae-
torship we find him in 89 in Spain, charged by Domitian
with the taslc of leading the Legio 1 Adiutrix from that province
to Upper Germany,6 The object of this transfer has frequently
been misunderstood. Trajan was not governor of Hispania
Tarraconensis, which was a consular appointment, nor was he at
Ι this time made legate of Upper Germany, for the command of
