the attempted treachery of Decebalus,1 and by the capture and
voluntary death of Cassius Longinus. Baffled and defeated,
Decebalus put an end to his own life, and Trajan, now saluted
ΙΜΡ. Vl, determined to complete his work by the annexation
of Dacia.2 The Dacian population was almost completely
exterminated, and colonists were introduced into the new
province from every part of the Roman world,⁸ but especially
from the denationalised population of Asia Minor.4 Roman
civilisation and language were introduced, and a considerable
commercial and mining activity was developed.⁵ Sarmize-
· gethusa was made a Roman colony; other towns received the
‘ius Italicum,’ while the province was garrisoned by a legion,
the XIllth Gemina, stationed at Apulum. At the same time,

to strengthen the frontier arrangements, an important military .

camp was formed at Troesmis while Paetovi0, Ratiaria, Oescus6
and Marcianopolis⁷ were either founded or refounded. Pannonia
was divided into an ,Upper and Lower province, and military
roads were made or repaired throughout the Haemus region.8
By the end of 106 A.D. Trajan was again in Rome⁹ A third
‘congiarium' was given to the people, and for 123 days
gladiatorial games and ‘venationes' were exhibited in the
Colosseum.

A year previously the extinction of the Idumaean line
of kings reigning in Trachonitis brought the empire into
immediate relations with the turbulent Nabataean tribes of
Arabia Petraea Considering that their¹ plundering raids would
be a continual annoyanee to Syria, and that the important
caravan routes from Mesopotamia passed through this region,
Trajan gave orders to Cornelius Palma, the legate of Syria, to
annex the country. Its acquisition as a province in 105, and
the posting of a legion, the Illrd Cyrenaica, at Bostra was
followed by the establishment of order, and by all the material
signs of civilisation in the shape of aqueducts, roads, and
