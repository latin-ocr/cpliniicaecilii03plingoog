reign, as is it was equally well known at that time. Whether this is

true or not, it is absolutely unafiected by Dr. Lightfoot's arguments.
xPassing from the events of Nero’s to those os Domitian's reign, and ¹,
from Tacitus and Suetonius to Dio Cassius or his epitomator, Dr. Light- “
foot confesses that ‘the account of Dio Cassius respecting the proceed-

ings taken by this emperor against Flavius Clemens and Domitilla seems

at first sight to favour the view that the two religions were identified at

this time’ But, he proceeds, ‘we must remember that these are not

’ the words of the historian himself. It is just in 'incidents of this kind

that an epitome is most likely to mislead3 and even the epitomator

does not distinctly say that Flavius Clemens and Domitilla were them-
selves among the perverts to Jewish practices. The notice is entirely
satisfied by the supposition that offences not identical‚ but similar in ls
kind—offences, namely, which the Roman law regarded as “atheism ”—

are classed together in a rough way. When for instance Tacitus (Ann.

ii. 8 5) says, “ A debate was held on the expulsion os Egyptian and Judaic
ceremonies (de sacris Aegyptiis Iudaicisque pellendis); and a decree of

the senate was passed ordering that four thousand persons of the class j, ¹
of freedmen, tainted ror‘tlr tlrat superstition (ea superstitione infecta), who

were os a proper age, should be transported tot the island of Sardinia,”

no one infers from this passage that either the authors of the decree ,,

’ themselves, or the historian who records it, identified the worship of y]

Isis and Serapis with the religion of the Jews, though from a Roman b
point of view the association of the two would appear in the highest
degree naturaL’ The passage from Tacitus may be disposed of at once.

It has no sort of analogy with the notice in Dio Cassius. The Egyptian

and Jewish rites are clearly spoken of as different The ‘ea supersti-
tione' does not really conceal this difference, as, though certainly not
without ambiguity, it refers only to the Jews. This, the natural inter·
⁴ pretation even os Tacitus's words by themselves, is proved to be correct

by the corresponding passage in Suetonius (Tib. 36): “Externas caeri-
monias, Aegyptios Iudaicosque ritus compescuit . . . Iudaeorum
iuventutern per speciem sacramenti in provincias gravioris caeli dis-

tribuit.'' The passage in Dio Cassius (quoted onp5 65) rsof quitea

different character: (ἔπηνεχθη δὲ ἀμφοῖν ἔγκλημα ἀθεότητος rid ἧς και
ἄλλοι’ εις τὰ τῶν Ιουδαίων ἤθη ἔξοκέλλοντες πολλοὶ κατεδικάσθησανῘ
It seems to me absolutely impossible to avoid the conclusion that
the writer of these words, whether Dio Cassius or his epitomator,
classed Clemens and Domitilla under the same head as the Judaisers
whom he next mentions We may regard them all as Jewish proselyteS‚
or we may, as is usually and more probably done, regald them all as
Christ trans, but it is, in Dr Lightfoot's wordS, ‘a wholly gratuitous
assumpt ion 'which would never occur to any one who had no particular
point to prove by it, to say that Clemens and Domitilla were Christians
and the rest Jewish proselytes.1 Nor do I understand the point which

¹ li the two classes had been regarded by the writer as different, he would have used
