These would include not only the great

stipendiariae—but also the municipia,
coloniae, and towns of Latin right.

Ep. 34, where a collegium fabrorum
is refused to Nicomedeia; aud Ep. 96,

clubs and associations of this sort were
technically ‘hetaeriae': Gaius, Digest,

collegii sunt, quam Graeci ἑταιρίαν

fus trium liberorum amrin petit

C. PLINIUS TRAIANO IMPERATORI

Suetonium Tranquillum, probissimum honestissimum eru-
ditissimum virum, et mores eius secutus et studia iam pridem,
domine, in contubernium adsumpsi tantoque magis diligere
2 coepi, quanto hunc propius inspexi. Huic ius trium liberorum
necessarium faciunt duae causae: nam et iudicia amicorum

5 1. Suetonius Tranquillus, sire, isa
man of the greatest honesty, integrity, and
learning, whom in consequence of his
tastes and character Ι have long since
admitted to my intimate friendship, and
the more closely 1 have seen him, the
more I have learned to love him. 52.
He desires the ius trium liberorum for two
reasons, that his friends may give effect
to their favourable judgment of himin
their wills, and that our kindness may
afford him what an unfruitful marriage has
denied. 5 3. Ι know how great a favour
Iam asking. but Ι remember your pre·
vious indulgence to my requests. Ι should
not make the request from a distance,
were l not so anxious to obtain it.

5 1. Suetonium Tranquillum. C.
Suetonius Tranquillus was of equestrian
rank. His father Suetonius Lenis served
on Otho’s side in the war against Vitel-
lius as ‘tertiaedecimae legionis tribunus
angusticlavius,' Suet. oraro. Suetonius
was himself born somewhat about that
time, as he describes himself as an adol·
escens twenty years after Nero's death.
Suet. Ner. 57, and also Suet. Dum. 12,
‘interfuisse me adolescentulum memini
cum a procuratore frequentissimoque

consilio inspiceretur nonagenarius} senex,
an circumsectus esset.' He was an inti·
mate friend of Pliny ‘contubernalis meus,'
aad also a man of letters,’ ‘scholasticis
porro dominis, ut hic est,' as early as 97
mn. (Ep. i24). Pliny writes to him, i
18, iii 8,v ro, and xi 34 In toran.
Pliny obtained for him a military tribune·
ship under Neratius Marcellus (Ep. iii 8)
which however Suetonius preferred to
pass on to a relation. Under Hadrian
he held the post oi ab epistulis, from
zhaidch however he was dismissed, Spart.

ln contubernium adsumpsi, ad·
mitted to my intimate friendship. Cf.
Ep. i 24, ‘contubernalis meus'; alsoi 19,
‘municeps meus et condiscipulus et ab
ineunte aetate contubernalis.'

Cf. Suet. Aug. 66, ‘amicorum suprema
