other at Tibiscum before reaching Sarmizegethusa. At this
time there were nine legions posted along the Danube between
Vindobona and Durostorum. From those, no doubt, the army
of Trajan was selected, though he also had strong bodies of
the praetorian cohorts and some Moorish cavalry under Lusius
Quietus. Licinius Sura was chief of his staff and Hadrian
his quaestor. The first war occupied two campaigns. The
Dacians, helped by German and Sarmatian tribes, offered an
obstinate resistance; but, undeterred by a waming message
from the Bures,1 and by two embassies from DecebaluS, Trajan
steadily advanced towards the capital. Two battles were
apparently fought, and Tibiscum and finally Sarmizegethusa
captured. The result was that Decebalus was compelled to
destroy his fortresses, surrender his engines of war, as well
as the Roman deserters, and become a client of Rome. For
two years the peace was maintained. Trajan received the title

1 of Dacicus, assumed the consulship for the fifth time in 103,

and distributed a second ‘congiarium ' to the people. Decebalus,
however, who had apparently entered into some communica· ·
tions with PacoruS, king of Parthia,2 at once resumed his former
tactics; fresh fortresses were raised, the territory of the Iapyges,
now allies of Rome, violated, and the natural inaccessibility of
the country increased, while attacks were probably made on
the garrisons left in the country by Trajan.⁸ The emperor
had, no doubt, foreseen some such result, and with a view to
future operations had commissioned Apollodorus of Damascus
to build a permanent bridge across the Danube at Drobetae, a
marvel of engineering skill and boldness4 At the end of '104
war was again declared by the senate, and next year Dacia
was once more invaded. Details are even scantier than in the
former war. The Dacians apparently had this time no allies, ¹
while, in addition to the former routes, an army seems t0 have
advanced up the valley of the Aluta, and through the Rothen-
thurm⁶ The difficulties of the campaign were great, but con-
sisted more in the nature of the country to be traversed and
the maintenance of communications than in th'e actual resistance
encountered. Some romance was added to the campaign by
