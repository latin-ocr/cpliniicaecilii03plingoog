82 C. PLINI ET TRAIANI

Mommsen roves (Hamus, iii) that the
consules suiiecti for the year were desig·
nated on January 9. As Nerva died on
January 27, Pliny must have received his
appointment between those two dates in
9 an.

praefecturam aerarii Saturni.
Under the republic the aerarium Saturni
was the only treasury‚ and was admin-
istered by the two city quaestors. Mar·
quadt, Staatsverw. ii. p. 299. But Au·
gustus after the division of the provinces
in2713.c. created two new treasuries, the
fiscus into which came the proceeds of the
imperial provinces, and the aerarium mili·
tare, founded in 6 an. and supported by
the vicesima hereditatum aud the cen·
tesima rerum venalium. The aerarium
Saturni in addition to its former revenues
now received the proceeds ol the sena-
torial provinces. Nominally the senate
had the disposal of it, aud was allowed
by Augustus to choose praelects (Tac.
Anu. 1 75, and xiii 29), who were
praetorii in rank, Dio Cass. 53, 2.
ίδύο κατ’ ἔτος ἐκ τῶν ἐκστρατηγηκότων
αἱρεῖσθαι ἐκέλευε, and Suet. Aug. 36;
but virtually the emperor had the real
power 3 Dio Cass. 53, 16.

Tac. Ann. xiii 29 gives the history of
the office up to Nero, ‘Varie habita ac
saepe mutata eius rei forma. Nam
Augustus senatui permisit deligere prae·
fectos: deinde ambitu suffragiorum sus-
pecto, sorte ducebantur ex numero prae·
torum, qui praessent: neque id diu man-
sit, quia sors deerrabat ad parum idon·
eos. Tunc Claudius quaestores rursum
imposuit3 iisque, ne metu offensionum
segnius consulerent, extra ordinem
honores promisit. Sed deerat robur
aetatis, cumprimum magistratum capes-
sentibus. Igitur Nero praetura perfunc-
tos, et experientia probatos delegit.' See
also Suet. Claud. 24, Dio Cass. 60, 43
Tac. Hz'st. iv 9 shows that Vespasian
appointed praetores again. Since Nerva
two praefecti aerarii were appointed by
the emperor from the· number of the
praetorir to hold office for three years.
The praefects had to administer the
aerarium, to assign money for various
purposeS, and to superintend the jurisdic-
tion of all treasury cases. See Marquadt.

the advocatus was a jurisconsult who did
not speak for his client in court, which
was the duty of the orator or patronus,
but simply supported the points of law
by his opinion or presence. Under the

qulbus numquam oram promiscue
functus. Pliny began his career as an
advocate when still young ; Ep. i 18, 3,
‘eram acturus adolescentulus adhuc)
Both in this letter, and in vi 23 he speaks
as an advocate much in vogue, and able
to give advice and patronage to younger
and less ex erienced men. He usually
pleaded beihre the centumviri in cases
relating to wills and successions; Ep. vi
12, 2, ‘in arena mea, hoc est apud cen-
tumviros'; and Mart. x 19, ‘Totos dat
(Plinius) tetricae dies Minervae, Dum
centum studet auribus virorum’ See also
iv 16; iv 213 v 9, 2; ix 23, 1‚erc.
On two occasions he takes up the cause
ofa town, as that of his native place„
Comum, Ep. ii 5, and that of Firmum,
vi 18. Ordinary criminal cases before the
praetors, he only mentions twice, i 18,
6, and vi 33, 9. Of state trials on the
charge of repetundae before the senate,
Pliny had up to this time only under·
taken one, viz. that on behalf of the pro·
vincials of Baetica against Baebius Massa,
the proconsul there. See vii 33, and vi
29. After a preliminary inquiry ‘an
danda esset inquisitio,’ the case was tried
before the senate, Pliny and Herennius
Senecio being appointed advocates of the
province by the senate. Massa was con·
demned, and it was decreed ‘ut bona eius
publice custodirentur) The date is fixed
by Tac. Agr. 45, ‘et Massa Baebius iam
iil? rpus erat,’ zie. at the death of

Cf. iii 9, 1, whence it appears that
it was not the province collectively,
‘sed Marium una civitas publice multi·
que privati reum peregerunt,‘ zze. it was
not the ‘concilium provinciae' as in the
case of Varenus, vii ὁ, but only one town .
