govemment had pursued, and set out ior the cast at the end
os 113 A.D.1 There were at this time seven legions along the
eastern frontier between Cappadocia and Arabia These,
however, as was usually the case with the oriental legions,
were demoralised and undisciplined‚ and Trajan led over troops
. from Pannonia, as well as strong bodies from the praetorian
cohorts. Starting from Antioch, and avoiding the route
through the desert by marching along the Upper Euphrates
into Little Armenia, Trajan received at Satala the submission
of the petty kings of the Caspian tribes, whom he securcd in
their kingdomS,2 and made clients of the empire. To Partha-
masiriS, who came to pay his homage to Trajan at Elegeia, a .
different reception was given. His homage was refused,3
and his kingdom made into a Roman province,4 while he him-
sell, either with or without Trajan's connivance, met with a
violent death⁵ The campaign of the next year (115) was
marked by an advance into Osrhoene and the submission of
its king, Abgarus, while Lusius Quietus, advancing farther into
the east, occupied the district surrounding Singara and Nisibis.
These successes were marked by the tenth, eleventh, and twelsth
salutations as imperator, and by the end oi the year another
new province with Nisibis as its capital was sormed under the
name of Mesopotamia,6 while Trajan now assumed the title os
Parthicus. The winter oi this year was spent at Antioch,
where during Trajan’s stay a terrific earthquake took place,
while the martyrdom of ignatius is ¹most probably to be
assigned to the same time. The next year (116) the Tigris
was crossed and Adiabene conquered, after which Trajan
marched down the right bank of the Tigris to Babylon.
Meanwhile ships had been built in the neighbourhood os
Nisibis, and eonveyed across country to the TigriS, which was
crossed for the second time in the late summer, and Ctesiphon
the Parthian capital was taken the same year.⁷ A third
province was added under the name of Assyria,8 and the
formidable Parthian empire seemed to be crushed. These
