made into the doings of the association failed to bring home to
the accused anything impiouS, immoral, or disloyal; and (2)

the very numbers of the accused made a continuation of the
same course almost impossible. The rescript of Trajan to a
great extent relieved him from his difficulty. The emperor at
once dismisses the charges of immorality, sacrilege, murder,
and what-not m'ade against them by their accusers, and there·
fore decides that Pliny need take no initiative in the matter
(conquirendi non sunt) 3 while the veto on anonymous accusa·
tions would no doubt immensely diminish the number of those
put forward by spiteful and envious Jews. On the other hand,
Trajan commends Pliny’s past procedure, and distinctly lays it
down that all who are charged by responsible accusers and
N proved to be Christians, on refusing to deny the name, and, as
‘' a test of bona fides to worship the state gods, are to be ex-
ecuted. This, then, is the first distinct and-legal ordinance
made respecting the Christians. It amounts, there is no doubt,
to an edict of proscription. The profession of Christianity, as
such, if proved on satisfactory groundS, was a punishable offence.
The effects‚ however, of this proscription were to a large extent
modified by the fact that Christians were not to be searched
out, and that anonymous accusations were forbidden. It is'·
clear, on the one hand, that Trajan pays little regard to their
religious opinions, since he is perfectly satisfied with a single'
instance of merely outward conformity, ‘supplicando diis nos·
tris ;’ while, on the other hand, it is impossible to suppose that
he saw in the Christians a serious political danger, or he would

surely have taken e'ffectual means to extirpate the danger,
Χ instead of instructing Pliny to abstain from all initiative in the
matter. Trajan was probably convinced, as apparently Pliny
was, that the Christian society was perfectly harmless‚ but it
’ was still none the lesS, or seemed to be, a collegium or hetaeria,
and one which had never been licensed. On this ground it
was impossible to recognise, and indeed necessary to proscribe
it, though, so far as the govemment was concerned, the pro·
scription might remain practically a dead letter unless the
Christians themselves did anything to bring them under the
head of latrones or sacrilegi, or unless bona fide accusations
were brought against them. That the edict opened out the
possibility of a legal persecution there is no doubt, for it was
