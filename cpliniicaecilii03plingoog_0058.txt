INTRODUCTION 41

(5) Ama iv 15. Lucilius Capit0, procurator of Asia, was
accused by the province and condemned, the emperor
asserting ‘non se ius nisi in servitia et pecunias

. familiares dedisse)

(6) Arm. iv 18. C. Silius, legatus Germaniae superioris, was
accused by SeianuS, mainly os maiestaS, and promoting
civil war, but a charge of repetundae was added, and
the accused anticipated condemnation by suicide.

(7) Amr. iv 31. P. Suillius, formerly the quaestor of Ger-
manicuS, on being convicted ‘pecuniam ob rem
iudicandam cepisse' was ‘relegatus in insulam.³ ’

(8) Arm. vi 29. Pomponius Labeo, legatus Moesiae, was
accused, ‘male administratae provinciae‚’ and committed
suicide.

Of these eight cases it will be observed that only two
relate to imperial provinces; that all were convicted or antici-
pated conviction by suicide, and that the punishment ranges
from a mere pecuniary reimbursement to actual deportatio

Under Claudius, whose provincial administration apparently
also followed the Augustan tradition, we have two cases only
in Tacitus.

(1) Ann. xii 22. Cadius Rufus was accused by the Bithyn-
ians under the lex repetundarum, and condemned.
That he was expelled from the senate we know de·
finitely from the statement (Hist. i77), that he was
restored to it by Otho.

(2) Arm, xii 59.Ι Statilius Taurus, proconsul of Africa, was
accused by his legate Tarquitius Priscus, of repetundae‚
and committed suicide. This was, however, apparently
not a bona fide accusation, but was due to the intrigues
of Agrippina.

The first'six years of Nero's reign were marked by an
excellent provincial administration on the whole, though we
have no sewer than eleven cases of repetundae in this time.

(1) Arm. xiii 30. Vipsanius LaenaS, proconsul of Sardinia,
was accused ‘ob provinciam avare habitam' and
condemned.
