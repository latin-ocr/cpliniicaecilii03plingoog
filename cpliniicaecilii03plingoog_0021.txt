mates,’ was taken into the empire, a step which not only forced
back the Chatti, but made the frontier of the empire in this
quarter far more compact; rendered the presence of a strong
garrison at both Vindonissa and Argentoratum no longer neces-
sary, and so enabled the German provinces to dispense with
half its former military force.1 Inadequate as our information
is, there is no doubt that this change of the frontier line was
what mainly occupied Trajan in Germany. Eutropius tells us
vaguely that he restored the cities beyond the Rhine,² and we
know that he built a fort ‘munimentum Traiani’ opposite to
Maintz, and also founded a ‘civitas Ulpia’ near Ladenberg³ on
the Neckar, as well as a town on the site of Baden.4 Mean-
while the feeble Nerva at Rome, finding himself unable to pre-
serve the imperial dignity against the turbulent praetorians,⁵
determined, partly on the advice of Licinius Sura‚⁶ to make
Trajan his adopted son and successor. This he did on October
2 7, 97 A.D., in the presence of the people assembled in the
Capitol to celebrate a military success just announced from
Pannonia over the Suevi.⁷ Confidence was at once restored at
Rome ; nor do we hear of any discontent with the election
among the legions either of the Danube or the East. Trajan
at once received the title of imperator, and also the ‘tribunicia
potestas,' while he entered, on his second consulship in 98.
Nerva did not long survive this, the most important act of his
reign. He died january 28, 98 A.D.; and Trajan thus became
sole imperator. The news reached him at Cologne, where he
was engaged in regulating the affairs of Lower Germany, notas
legate of the province, but as imperator. Here the Rhine was
retained as the frontier‚ but Trajan strengthened the Roman
defence by replacing the ruined Vetera, perhaps never restored
since its destruction by Civilis, by a new camp a few miles
farther to the north, which, under the name of Colonia Traiana,
became the headquarters of the new legion, the XXXth Ulpia
Victrix. Closely connected with Trajan’s German command is
the Germania of Tacitus, published in 98,8 and evidence of the
