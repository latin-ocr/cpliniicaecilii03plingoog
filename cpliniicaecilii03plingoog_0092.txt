INTRODUCTION 75

and the marginal notes in that volume have led me, in some
instances already alluded to, to depart from Keil's text, and to
depart somewhat from his estimate of the Aldine edition.

My own notes are due principally to the help afforded by
Mommsen's Staatsreclzt; Marquadt's Staatsverwaltung,· Fried-
l'ander's Sz'ttengesclzz’clzte,· Pauly's Real Encyclopaedz'e,· De la
Berge's Essai sur la regne de Trajan ,· Dierauer's Zur Gesclziclcte
Τ rajans ,· and Mommsen's article on Pliny the Younger in
Hermes, vol. iii. For my notes and essay on the Christians,
I have consulted the discussions of Bandouin and Vossius ;

, Αιὼέ, Histoire des Persecutions,· and Schiller's Geschiclzte der

Kaizerzeit. My quotations I have usually given in full; and
tuith regard to inscriptions l have, wherever possible, made use
of those contained in Orelli, Henzen, and Wilmann.

No English edition of the Pliny-Trajan letters has yet been
published. Letters 4, 39, 40, 71, 72, and 96 are contained in
the ‘Select Letters’ published by Church and Brodrihh in
1871. The notes are, however, very brief ; and the editors
have evidently paid little attention to the history of these
letters, as they speak of certain readings being ‘in all the best
MSS? One or two of the letters were also published in the
selection of Pritchard and Bernard‚ Clarendon Press, 18 75 and
1887.

Of translations, thev two best are that of Melmoth, revised gs

by Bosanquet, Bohn’s Library, 18 78 ; and that of J. D. LewiS,
1879.
