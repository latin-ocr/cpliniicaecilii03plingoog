INTRODUCTION

Lus OF TRAJAN

MARCUS ULPIUs TRAIANUS, Roman emperor from 98-117 A.D.,
was born at Italica, in the province of Baetica, on September
18,1 52 or 53 Α.1).2 Italica had been founded by Scipio as an
asylum ior his wounded veterans,3 and therefore the Ulpian and
Traian gentes were probably, like the Aelian, of Italian origin.
Baetica had long been one of the most thoroughly Romanised ’
of the provinces and had contributed several illustrious names
to Roman politics and literature, but of the Ulpian gena, Trajan's
father, M. Ulpius Traianus, was the first who attained to curule
office at Rome and senatorial rank. We find him first in
the Jewish ,war under Vespasian‚ acting as legate of Legio X
’, Fretensis4 at the siege ol Joppa. This post implies a previous
praetorship, and his services in the war were rewarded by the
· consulship, probably in 69 Α.Ι). In 76 he was legate of Syria,5
and during his governorship some frontier hostilities with the
Parthians gave him the opportunity of winning the ‘trium-
· phalia ornamenta.’⁶ In this campaign his son, the future
emperor, served as military tribune, and, ii we may trust to the
courtly phrases oi Pliny, not without distinction⁷ In 79 an
