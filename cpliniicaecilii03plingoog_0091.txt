74 INTRODUCTION

Among other editions the most noteworthy are those of Veen-
husius, Rotterdam, 1669, with notes of Casaubon, Gruter,
ι H. Stephanus Buchner, Barthius, and Gronovius; of G. Cortius
and P. D. Longolius, Amsterdam, 1734, with notes os Catanaeus,
Casaubon, Stephanus, Ritterhusius, BarthiuS, Buchner, Schaeffer,
Gronovius, and Cellarius; the editio Oxoniensis, 1703, with
notes os Thomas Hearne and otherS, and the first sketch of
Pliny's Life by Masson; of Gierig, Leipzig, 1800; and of
Gesner and Schaeffer, Leipzig, 1805.

In 1833 J. C. Orelli published the Pliny-Trajan letters
separately, ‘ab interpolationibus purgatae,' with the ‘Historia
Critica Epistolarum Plinii et Traiani' prefixed: This is, how·
ever, throughout vitiated (1) by the mistaken supposition that
the edition of Beroaldus was published before that of Avantius;

’ and (2) by his having at that time never seen the second edition

of Catanaeus os 1518. These mistakes, however, he corrected
in a later edition of the Historia Critica published in 1838.
Ore'lli's edition contains a few critical notes on the most cor-
rupt passages, and the apparatus criticus is fully given at the

, soot os each page.

In 1843 all the letters were published, with German ex-
planatory notes, by Moritz Doring at Freiberg. The edition,
however, is of little value. For the text, too much dependence
is placed upon Orelli, and the mistake about the date of the
edition of Beroaldus and Avantius, although corrected by
Orelli five years previously, is inexcusably repeated by Doring.
Iam indebted to this edition for a few references principally
to Quintilian and Seneca, but though Ι have had his notes
before me, Ι 3111 not aware that Ι havemade any further use
of them. In disputed passages Ι have seldom been able to
follow the text which he adopts,

, 111 1870 was published the critical edition os H. Keil, with
its exhaustive discussion on the sources for the text of Pliny,
and its invaluable index os proper names at the end drawn up
by Mommsen. To both of them, it is needless to say, Ι
have been indebted at every step. The variant readings which
Ι subjoin to each page are in a great measure taken from
Keil’s edition, not blindly, however, for l have carefully collated
the editions of Avantius and Aldus, and, less thoroughly, the
first edition of Catanaeus. The discovery of the Bodleian MS.
