70 INTRODUCTION

ξ ξ 3. B. Kalendis Septembribus: Ald. Kal Septembris: B.'s
reading was conjectured by G. H. Schaeffer.

10, 1. B. institutiones: Ald. institutionem.

το, 2. B. ecce autem: Ald. esse autem: B’s. error is
clearly due to misreading os a MS.

17 B, ξ 5. Β, quam cum maxime tracto: Ald. quam cum
Maximo tracto: the Ald. reading was followed by all editions
till that of Cortius who adopted ‘curn maxime' srom Perizonius.

18,§ 1. B. et navigationi: Ald. ut navigationi: the real
reading being no doubt ‘ei navigationi’

23, ξ 1. B. itaque tamen aestimamus novum fieri quod: Ald.
id itaque indulgentia tua restituere desiderant. Ego tamen
aestimans novum fieri-see note ad loc.

29, ξ 2. B. ut iam dixerant sacramento ita nondum: Ald.
utiam dixerant sacramento militar i nondum.

37, ᾗ 2. B. peragenda erit: Ald. agenda erit.

39, ' 1. Β. desedit: Ald. descendit. ’

39, 5. B. quam buleutae addit: Ald. quam buleutae addunt:

Casaubon.

With regard to the MS. letters of Book viii it must suffice
here 'to say that they differ from Aldus in twenty-one readings,
sour being mere errors of the scribe: os the remaining seventeen,
B. is in twelve confirmed by the Medicean Codex, which contains
these letters: in three others by citations in Budaeus, who, as we
have seen, used the Parisian codex: and in two by both M. and
Budaeus. Thus in both sets of MS. letters, Β. proves to be
nearer to the original readings than Aldus.

With regard to the marginal readings to the two printed
editions oi Beroaldus and AvantiuS, of which there are alto·
gether 207, the most striking point is that no less than 173
os them appear in the Aldine edition, the divergences between
the marginal commentator and Aldus being sewer in the IX
Books than in the Pliny-Trajan letters. Of the thirty-four
cases of difference between the marginal reading and Aldus,
about half are to be explained by the fact that Aldus mostly
followed previous editions, while in other cases he has clearly
added interpolations of his own. Taking into account (1) the
overwhelming preponderance of cases of agreement between
the marginal readings and Aldus; (2) the express statement of
