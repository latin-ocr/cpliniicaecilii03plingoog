INTRODUCTJON 55

whose ‘frequent tumults in Alexandria and Judaea would no
doubt be known at Rome, and whose expulsion for riot under
Claudius was still fresh in the memory, would not unnaturally, is
suspicion was to be directed upon any sect or party, become the
victims ol it. Obviously the charge, against whomsoever it was
made, was no result of religious intolerance; it was a definite
charge, no doubt made at random‚ of incendiarism‚ and as
definite prool was wanting, but victims were necessary, the matter
· degenerated into amere repetition on a larger and fiercer scale
of the Jew·baitings which had not been unknown under Tiberius
and Caligula Their punishment was due not to conviction ol
guilt but to the ill odour in which they stood and the evil reputa·
tion of misanthropy they had incurred. That in the Jew·baiting ³
a number of Christians may have been included is probable in
itseli, and receives confirmation from the tradition oi the early
church, and it may have even been the case, as De Rossi and
Merivale suggest, that the Jews took the opportunity of calum-
‘ niating the Christians and so transferring much oi the sudden
,- odium from themselves to this hated sect. When Tacitus and
Suetonius wrote, the name oi Christians, though not their real
character, had become better known, and accordingly they are
mentioned as having been the objects of a persecution which in
reality they only shared as connected with the fanatical Jews.
That the persecution, if such a temporary and personal outbreak
of cruelty can be so called, was extended to the provinces, there
is not the smallest proof. It could only have been so extended
if Nero had become convinced that there was grave political
danger to be feared, and in this case much more would have been
heard of the matter than the brief and casual mention of Tacitus.
But if the Neronian persecution does not make a distinct 4
change in the position of Christianity, the result of the Jewish ¹
war did so ina marked degree and in more than one respect.
Hitherto the Judaising party among the Christians, whether in
a minority or not, had been sufficient to check the free growth
of Christianity as a universal religion ; with the destruction of

the Temple this check was removed, and the emancipation of
Christianity was complete. For its future development this
event was ol immense importance, but it involved several possi-
'bilities of danger which had not previously existed. In the first
place, the bitter hatred which hencelorth existed between Jews
