rarely came twice in a lifetime. Thus the system was bad
positively as well as negatively; bad in giving the freest

opportunity for all the excuses and contrivances of oppression

< in the invention of which Verres was only a member, perhaps

a representative, of a class ; bad also in providing no adequate
remedy‚ no certain punishment, and the smallest sense of
responsibility to a central power. On the one side were the
provincial governors, men often of little experience, military or
political, with the provincials practically at their feet. With
them was a numerous retinue of staff-officers and others who
had come out from Rome, all eager to profit by their appoint-

To pay off these debts and to lay by a competence for the
future was too often the one aim with which he entered on his
provincial administration, and what he did had to be done
quickly, for his term of office was usually only one year.
Itis perhaps no wonder that, with the exception of the older
Cato in Sardinia, it is hard to find a single instance of firmness
against temptation so strong and asystem so corrupt. For
those even who were content to put aside their own interests
might find in their friends, as Cicero found in Brutus insuper· ¹

μ At home no doubt, theoretically, there was a central

authority to which governors were responsible, and before·
which complaints might be laid, while there was a certain

to do much good, in favour of establishing checks and bringing

about improvement. The provincials might always accuse a
