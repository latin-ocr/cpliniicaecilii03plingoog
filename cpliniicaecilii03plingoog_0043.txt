26 INTRODUCTION

bourhood of his native place Comum.l His mother’s property
had suffered to some extent from agricultural depression ;2 but
still Northern Italy was less liable ‚tou this than Latium or
Campania, and if these had been his only estates, with the
two villas he called ‘Tragedy' and ‘Comedy’ on the borders of
the lake,³ he would probably have seemed to Juvenal or Martial
a man to be envied. But he had another large estate in Etruria
near the town of Tifernum Tiberinum,4 which, as he himself
tells Trajan,⁵ brought in an annual revenue os 400,000 sesterces,
while he had a splendid suburban villa at Laurentum,6 seventeen
miles from Rome, and others at Tusculum,⁷ Tibur, and Prae*
neste.8 Still, though rich, Pliny was no millionaire. His pro-
perty was mostly in land,9 and the severe agricultural depression
of the time,1⁰ heightened by bad seasons and poor vintages‚11
made a certain amount of economy and management necessary,12
especially as his official dignity had to bekept up, and the
claims of friendship and public munificence were never dis-

raise, with a little help from his mother-in-law‚ the sum of three
million sesterces for the purchase of an estate adjoining his
own.13 His liberality, both public and private, was unwearied.'
At one time he gives a fellow-townsman 300,000 sesterces to
make up the equestrian census ;14 at another he contributed
100‚000 towards the wedding-dower of a friend's daughter ;1⁵
at another he helped Artemidorus the philosopher to satisfy
his clamorous debtors.16 The poet Martial received some help
towards his journey home to Spain.1⁷ Quintilian was presented
by his old pupil with a sum of 50,000 sesterces for his daughter's
dower,18 while an old nurse was settled comfortably on a little
farm which Pliny bought for her.19 If acts like these prove a
kindly and generous feeling for friends, Pliny's public acts of
liberality are a striking proof, not only of patriotism, but of an
interest in the spread of education and culture which, in spite
