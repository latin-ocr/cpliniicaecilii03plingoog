INTRODUCTJON 'll

Aldus that he was'¹ indebted to Iucundus for a copy of the
codex; and (3) the similar mention of Iucundus on the last
page of the Bodleian copy. I think there is little doubt 'but
that these marginal readings are taken from the copy of the
codex which Iucundus supplied. In the six following pass-
ages the readings in the margin, though differing from Aldus,
are clearly nearer to the original reading, and in several cases
anticipate late conjectures.

78, j 2. B. (ie. Avantius corrected by margin), quanto in-
firmiores erunt, idem petent. Aldus interpolates a number ol
words and omits ‘idem' ᾖ

96, j 10. B. pastumque venire victimarum: Ald. passimque
venire victimas

- 102. B. diem quo in te tutela; Ald. diem in quem
tutela; B’s reading was first conjectured by J. F. Gronovius.

Α 114, ξ 1. B. dum ne quem earum civitatum: Ald. dum
civitatis non sint alienae, sed suarum quisque matrum civitatum.
B's reading was conjectured by Orelli, and is an obvious cor·
rection of Avantius, ‘dum neque merum,' etc.

[πάξ 2. B. confirmed by Budaeus, ‘concedendum iussisti
invitationes' Aldus has ‘concedendum iussi invitationes'

116, j 2. Β. dianomes: Avantius ‘Diamoeries'; Aldus
‘diamones '3 dianomes was conjectured by Casaubon.

That this Bodleian copy belonged to Aldus himself who
corrected the printed editions from Iucundus' copy and the codex,
and had the missing letters copied in from the same source, is
tolerably evident from what has been said, and as Ι have
shown in the Journal of Philology, it is confirmed by various
little corrections and marks evidently intended as printer’s
directions, which run through the whole book, and agree with
the Aldine edition.

If this is the correct account of the matter, some fresh
light is thrown on the way in which Aldus used his authorities
and Keil's judgment upon him must be modified. Wherever
Aldus and B. agree, as they do in the great majority of cases,

<Aldus has conscientiously followed the copy of the codex,

’ while in cases of disagreement he either (1) took the reading

of previous editions, or (2) inserted interpolations and conjec-

tures of his own, or possibly (3) made alterations from the

original codex, when he received it from Mocenig0.' .
