INTRODUCTION 19

Pliny's official career seems to have begun, and he was appointed
by the senate, into which, if he was not of senatorial rank
before, he must have been previously promoted by the emperor,1 Α
one of the ‘decemviri stlitibus iudicandis,’² one of the minor
'magistracies (vigintiviratus)'regularly held before the quaestor·
ship, and which under the empire had the presidency‚ under
superintendence of a praetor, of the centumviral οοιιτῖ.3 How
long this office was held is uncertain, but Pliny's next step in
the senatorial career was the military tribuneship. He was
appointed, no doubt by the emperor, to the Legio ΙΙΙ Gallica,
which at that time and for many years previously was posted in
Syria.4 It is possible that Pliny’s was the mere ‘semestris
militia’;⁶ certain that at any rate he was one of the ‘tribuni
honores petituri,'⁶ without any view to military promotion, and
he seems to have been employed in a non-military capacity in
auditing the accounts of some of the auxiliary forces,⁷ while he
found time and opportunity in Syria to cult 1vate the friendship
of Euphrates8 and Artemidorus,9 two of the philosophers ban-
ished from Rome by Vespasian. Pliny probably ret turned from
Syria about 83 or 84 Ἀ..,Ι) when he was appoint ted ‘Sevir
Equitum Romanorumss a posit ion which probably involved no
real dutieS, and the next office he would look forward to would
be the quaestorship, but this he could not hold till his twenty-
tifth year,1⁰ and as the competition for this office was usually
severe, it was perhaps only exceptional for it to be held so
soon. Pliny was probably quaestor fgom 1st July 89 to 3oth
June 90 AD, and a proof that he at that time enjoyed the
emperor's favour is the fact that he was ‘quaestor CaesariS,' ¹¹ iu,
he was subordinated not to any of the proconsuls of the
senatorial provinces, but to the proconsular power of the
emperor himself, who employed his quaestors, among other
dutieS, to read to the senate any message or speech which he
ι wished not to deliver in person.12 These quaestors were no
doubt always ‘candidati Caesaris! The next office which
Pliny held was that of‘ tribunus plebis' Between this and the
