ΟΝ PLINY AND THE CHRISTIANS

S1rvca this book has passed through the press my attention has been
called to the treatment of the question by Bishop Lightfoot (Apostolic
Fatum, Part ii. pp. 1-21), who, while taking the view adopted in the
Introduction that Trajan did not definitely and for the first time intro
duce a policy of persecution, and that his rescript was actuated by
political considerations rather than religious, and had reference mainly

of the distinction between them and the Christians than they were with
such menas Gallio in the provinces? Dr. Lightsoot thinks they would,
because ‘they had a powerful advocate at headquarters lf Nero ruled ,x
the world, Poppaea ruled Nero' Poppaea was no doubt affected by b*
