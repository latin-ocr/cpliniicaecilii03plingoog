was too polite to say so, and if he needed any revenge, he was

PROVINCES

Probably the darkest side in the republican government of
Rome was its provincial administration. Without attempting
to give illustrations here of the various acts of ‚oppressiom

especially the Verrine orations, are full, it will suffice to say
that the condition of the provinces was reduced to the very
lowest ebb. They were regarded merely as ‘praedia populi
Romani' (Cic. in Verr. ii 2, 3, 7); the senate had little or
no check upon the governors, and the governors had every
motive to make what they could out of an opportunity which
