issued by Pliny forbidding ‘hetaeriae ’; (11) to test the truth
of this statement, Pliny put two servants or possibly deacon·
esses, to the torture, but discovered nothing beyond ‘superstitio
prava immodica '3 (12) he consults Trajan, owing to the number
of those accused; sor (13) all ages, all ranks os society, town
and country, are affected by the contagion; (14) the temples
are almost deserted3 but (15) his plan of allowing recantation
to avert punishment has already begun to check the evil, and
he sees reason to hope that crowds os men will abjure Chris-
tianity if the procedure is confirmed by Trajan.

Several of these statements raise questions which it is not
altogether easy to answer, but the main difficulty is, that
whereas at the end of Domitian's reign there is nothing to
show either that the Christians were recognised as an inde-
pendent- sect, or regarded as dangerous to public order either
in Rome or the provinces we have here not only a recogni-
tion of their existence, but ‘to a certain extent an understanding
of. their position ; and yet Pliny hasselt himself justified in
executing mensor no other reason than the refusal to deny

their Christianity. The state of things which Pliny describes 1 ,

has not suddenly come about in Bithynia, sor he talks of reli· ι
gious ceremonies which have long been neglected; but Pliny’s

method of dealing with them is not a continuation oi any pro· .-
cedure taken by the proconsuls of the province, for the whole ⁴‘ ’

letter implies that the policy of interference is a new one. Nor
· is it possible to suppose that Trajan had issued a general edict
against the Christians in accordance with which Pliny had ’
acted, for such an edict would certainly have been mentioned
in the letter, and indeed would have rendered much of it un·
necessary. Again, when Pliny asserts that he had never been
present at any Christian trialS, does he imply that such trials ·
had taken place, and, if 80, when and where? lf the view

taken above of the events in Domitian’s reign'is a correct one, , .

he cannot allude to any trials at Rome, forthere no Christians ’ ”
had been tried as such, and in any case we cannot conceive
that Pliny, who was interested in every detail of the law courtS,
should have remained ignorant oi thern and of their procedure
if they had taken place. It seems to me that the solution of
the whole question must be found in the position of the oriental
. provinces generally, and perhaps of Bithynia in particular, in
