C. PLINI ET TRAIANI

agonas qui Traiani appellarentur. Quod in notitiam tuam

coins have Τεῖος and Τειανοί) was also on
the coast, 38 miles from Heraclea, Plin.

opera facienda. It was no unusual
‚ thing for money to be left to civitates for
such purposes. Dz'g. 30, 122, ‘Civi-
tatibus legari potest etiam quod ad hono-
rem ornatumque civitatis pertinet: ad
ornatum puta, quod ad instrumentum,
forum, theatmm, stadium legatum fuerit:
ad honorem puta quod ad munus eden-
dum, venationem ve ludos scenicos, ludos
Circenses relictum suerit.'

instituendos quinquennales ago·
nas. These periodical local agones,
which comprised the usual gymnastic
contestS, and sometimes musical compe-
titions also, were extremely common
among the Greek-speaking parts of the
empire. As Trajan says to Pliny, ‘Gym-
nasiis indulgent Graeculi,' and the towns
of Asia Minor vied with one another in
the splendour of these celebrations‚ occa·
sionally, for the sake of greater alat,
calling them after the name of the reign-
ing emperor. Augustus had set the
example of encouraging these agones
hy establishing quinquennial games at
Nicopolis in commemoration of the battle
of Actium. Suet. Aug. 18, ‘urbem
Nicopolim apud Actium credidit, ludos-
que illic quinquennales constituit¹; and
c. 98, ‘tamen et quinquennale certamen
gymnicum, honori suo institutum, per·
spectavit.' These, however, were more
than local contests; they were rather
placed on the same standing as the
Olympian Games, and time was even
reckoned occasionallybyActiads, Ioseph.
Bell. Iud. i 20, 4. This example was
soon taken up in the provinces. The
first King Herod of Judaea founded simi-
lar games in 8 uc, Ioseph. Ant. Iud.
xvi 5, 1 ; and a large number of towns in
the other provinces did the same; Suet.
Aug. 59, ‘Provinciarum pleraeque super
templa et aras ludos quoque quinquen-
nales paene oppidatim constituerunt¹
In Antioch and Alexandria indeed the
quinquennial games thus established were

‘riv ἐν Ἀντιοχείᾳ lepov πενταετηρικὸν

ii 4136. Nor were these games confined
entirely to the East. Quinquennial
games were established in Rome under
the care of the four priestly colleges,
Dio Cass. 53, 1, and Momms. Res.
Gest. d. Aug. p. 413 and that those com·
prised the Greek athletic exercises is
proved by Suet. Aug. 44, ‘athletarum ,
vero spectaculo muliebre sexus omne
summovit,’ etc. Nero did the same thing
on a larger scale 3 Suet. Ner. 12, ‘Instit-
uit et quinquennale certamen primus
omnium Romae more Graeco triplex,
musicum, gymnicum equestre, quod ap·
pellavit Neronia.’ Cf. Tac. Ann. xiv 203
Eckhel, Dect. ll'um. v 264, ‘cun vao.
Rom. cort. s. c.' A similar, though
more permanent, institution was that of
the ‘agones Capitolini' by Domitian,
Suet. Doni. 43 Mart. iv 1, 63 Juv. vi
387. For the athletic portion of this
celebration Domitian built a stadium in
the Campus Martius, on the site of which
is the present Piazza Navona (Campus
Agonis). But though these Capitolini
agones were kept up for centuries at
Rome, they were never looked upon
with favour by the better classes of
Romans; nor were the towns in the
west allowed to follow the example of
the Greek provinces. Cf. Plin. Ep. iv
22, ‘Interfui principis optimi cognitioni,
in consilium adsumptus. Gymnicusagon
apud Viennenses ex cuiusdam testamento
celebrabatur. Hunc Trebonius Rufinus
. . . in duumviratu tollendum abolen-
dumque curavit. Negabatur ex auctori-
tate publica secisse. . . . Cum sententiae
perrogarentur, dixit Iunius Mauricus. . .
non esse restituendum Viennensibus ago·
na: adiecit “vellem etiam Romae tolli
posset.” . . . Placuit agona tolli, qui
mores Viennensium infecerat, ut noster
hic omnium' D'oring in his note ad loc.
misses the point. Mauricus expresses
his dislike and disapproval, not of the
‘Circenses’ but of Greek athletics, and
is alluding to the ‘agones capitolini.'
