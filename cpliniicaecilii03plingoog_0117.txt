ξ 1. My recent illness has put me
under au obligation to Postumius
Marinus, my physician, whom 1 can only
adequately reward by your help. ξ 2.
My petition therefore is that you will
grant the Roman civitas to some of his
relations, viz. to Chrysippus and his wife
Stratonice aud his children Epigonus and
Mithridates; and the ‘ius Quiritium’ to L.
Satrius Abascantus, P. Caesius Phos-

The reference to the illness approxi-
mately determines the date of the letter.

Postumio Marino. He evidently
had the civitas himself, having probably
received the iusta manumissio from one
ot the Postumiau gens. He was, how·

Epigono et Mithridati. The child-
ren according to the ordinary Greek
quslqom were named after their grand·

ita ut sint inparue potestate.
This is, of course, the natural conse·
quence of the father aud mother receiving
the civitas, which involved conubium.
Gaius, i 67, ‘quia non aliter quisquam
ad patris conditionem accedit, quamsi
iuter patrem et matrem eius conubium
sit,’ and he adds, ‘when wife and son
enter into the Romana civitas “ex eo
tempore incipit filius in potestate patris
esse.''' In order that Chrysippus might
have the ‘patria potestas,' it wasneces·

saryutbat his wife and sons should also
receive lt.

utque iis in libertos servetur ius
patronorum. This is an exceptional
privilege granted to the sons. As pere·
grini they bad the usual rights over their
reedmen, with which the father could
not interfere, but on coming under the -
patria potestas, the son would naturally
lose not only his right of testamentary
disposition and owning property, but
also his rights over his freedmen. These
consisted (1) in the general obsequium,
reverentia, or honour, which the freedman
had to render to his patron, Cic. ad.
Quint. frat. i 1, 4, Dionys. iv 24;
and (2) iu the fulfilment of certain pro-
mises made on the manumission to supply
dona, munera, bona, operae. Cic. ad
Atric. vii 2, adsum. xiv 43 (3) the
right of guardianship over the wives,
daughters, and infants of their freedmen ;
(4) claims on'the intestate succession to
the estates of their freedmeu; (5) the
right in case of ingratitude or impiety to
make the manumission void. Suet.
Claud. 25 ‘Ingratos (libertinos) et de
quibus patroni quererentur revocavit in*
servitutem’ This was, however, appar·
ently a temporary'measure, as we find
the same proposal made under Nero,
Tac. Ann. xiii 26: ‘Per idem tempus
actum in senatu de fraudibus libertorum,
efflagitatumque ut adversus male meritos
revocandaelibertatis ius patronis daretur)
It was, however, finally settled that they
should decide each case upon its merits
