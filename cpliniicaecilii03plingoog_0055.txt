38 INTRODUCTION

which began with Augustus, and also by the postal system which
he instituted along them. By these means, as we find in Pliny's
correspondence with Trajan, the smallest details might, if it was
considered advisable, be laid before the emperor for his decision.

Only second in importance to this preventive organisation
of the provinces were the remedial measures for instances of
power abused which might from time to time occur. The
cases of Licinius in Gaul (Dio Cass. 54, 21) and Lollius in
Armenia (Vell. Patere. ii 101) speedily proved that some such
remedies must be kept in reserve. In the provinces new facili-
ties of communication with the emperor were afforded by the
establishment of the provincial synods, or ‘consilia’ or ‘reolvdss
which met annually for religious celebrations at the altar of
Rome and Augustus ln these not only might votes of thanks
be passed to deserving governors (Tac. Arm. xv 203 Plin.
Panegyr. 70), like the laudations of republican days (cie. Verr.
ii 5, 263 iv 9, 633 pro Flacc. 153 ad Dr'v. iii 8), a practice
only temporarily forbidden by Nero (Amr. xv 21), but accusa-
⁴ tions might be formulated and legates appointed to conduct
them on behalf of the provinces at Rome.

The procedure in such cases was based, as has been already
stated, on the lex Iulia de repetundis of 59 Rc. But the
offences included under 'repetundae received throughout the

· empire a very considerable extension. The charge henceforth,

instead of relating solely, or even primarily‚ to monetary matterS,
was a general accusation, ‘male administratae provinciae’ (Tac.
Arm. vi 29), and included cruelty and oppression of every kind.
The quaestio de repetundis, though not formally abolished, was
practically no longer able to cope with the complexity which
charges of repetundae now often assumed, sor it was the
essential principle of the quaestiones that each should deal
with its own special offence, whether de vi, or de veneficiis or
de ambitu, or whatever it was. At first Augustus seems to
have constituted a special commission of consulars to try
charges against provincial governors (Suet. Aug. 73), ‘et pro·
vincialium (appellationes delegabat) consularibus viris quos
Α singulos cujusque provinciae negotiis praeposuit’3 but if the
passage is to be so explained, this plan was soon given up,
and the senate, or strictly speaking, the consuls presiding over
the senators as iudices became the usual tribunal before which ’
