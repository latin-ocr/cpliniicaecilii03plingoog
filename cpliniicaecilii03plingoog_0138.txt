Your procurator Maximus declares that vince are C. Iulius Aquila under Nero,
in addition to the ten beneficiarii, whom C. Ι. Gr. 3743. L. Antonius Naso under
by your orders l assigned to Gemellinus‚ Vespasian Eclrhel 11. 404: and Teren·
he also must have six. Meanwhile Ι tius Maximus under Domitian Plin. ad
have lest the three he already had in his Trai. 58. After Bithynia became an
service, especially as he is going to pro· imperial province (see Irrtrod.) there were

procuratorium. pOne class of pro·
curators was concerned with the collection
and settlement os all money paid into
tlte fiscus, both in the imperial and sena·
torial provinces; cs. Tac. Anu. iv 63
res suas Caesar spectatissimo cuique,
quibusdam ignotis ex sama mandabat ; ci.
also Tac Arm. xiii 1, ‘Ministri suere P.
Celer, eques Romanus, et Helius libertus,
rei familiari principis in Asia impositi.'
Of procurators in senatorial provinces we
have examples in Tac. Ann. iv 15, ‘ ro·
curator Asiae,' Tac. Hr'st. iv 503 ‘liae-
bius Massa e procuratoribus Africae)
Orell 3 570, proc. prov. Baeticae. Henr.
5456 proc. prov. Narbonensis Orell. 485,
proc· Ciliciae, etc, etc. In Bithynia there
was a procurator since the province be·
came senatorial, in 27 u.c., to manage
the royal domains which had , passed
into the emperor’s possession. See Dio
Cass. 5ο, 33, and Tac. Ann. xii 21, sor
Iunius Cilo, who was lor four years procu-
rator Bith iae, or asTacitus says, ‘proc
Ponti? ther procurators os the pro·

(vicesima libertatis); and (5)a procurator
for the import duty of ²l per cent. Henz.
5 530. Pliny had at least three procur·
ators under him, Gemellinus‚ Maximus,
his adjutor, and Epimachus; see Ep. 84.
These ‘procuratores rei privatae,' etc,
must be distinguished from (1) the pro·
curators who had the sole financial ad-
ministration oi the imperial provinces
and who on occcasions even had some
military power, Tac. Ann. iv 323 and
(2) those procurators who were placed
by the emperors over the smaller imperial
provinces which had no legions quartered
in them, such as Judaea, Thrace, etc,
see Tac. Htst. i 11 ; ‘duae Mauretaniae,
Raetia, Noricum, Thracia, et quae aliae
procuratoribus cohibentur,’ Arm. xv 44.

beneficiarios. See supra on Ep. 21.

Gemellino. Vindius Gemellinus was
a procuratores Bithynia; see infra, Ep.
28 and 84

optimo viro. Gemellinus was prob·
ably not a freedman, as is also implied
in Ep. 84, ‘adhibitis Virdio Gemellino et
Epimacho liberto meo procuratoribus.
